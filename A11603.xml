            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the queſtion is of the ſecond of theſe degrees mentioned; and ſurely, if we look to the ſtate of the world, this we ſhall finde; that either the favours of God move not, becauſe they are not apprehended as his favours, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as things that betide them by courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or fortune; or if they work any way, it is in <hi>Pejus,</hi> making them the more to<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2.4. and Iud. ver. 4.</note> deſpiſe God. But if the queſtion be <hi>De poſsibili,</hi> what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture elevated above it ſelf, by grace may aſcend unto, the ſolution is more difficult.

To <hi>Apollo;</hi> who howſoever they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching God, yet in univerſality they erred not; they meant it to that <hi>Numen,</hi> that they thought Authour of their good ſucceſſe: and ſurely, we cannot be too nice, and curious in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our gracious eſtate in this particular; for it is marvellous difficult to diſtinguiſh betwixt the loweſt degree of grace, and the higheſt of nature; eſpecially in gifts that are made Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and Characteriſticall, we ſhall finde the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill cunning in counterfeiting, &amp; I am perſwaded there is many a Chriſtian thorowly perſwaded of his faith, and love towards God, who yet erres in his perſwaſion; that is an excellent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that <hi>Salomon</hi> give us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17340:11"/> We are, Firſt, more carefull to pleaſe him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, More fearfull to offend him. Thirdly, More zealous for his glory.

               <p>There are three things that hinder ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of love to our God. Firſt, That many ſcarcely acknowledge any work of providence in ſwaying theſe outward things; ſuppoſing all guided by nature or fortune. Secondly, That we look not through ſecond cauſes to the chief, and principall ſender, whoſe but inſtruments theſe are, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16, 17. And we in part the like, as if the vigour of the diſeaſe becauſe of Nature ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or as if the cold of the time were the onely cauſe of mitigation; whereas if we would ſpeak, or think as Chriſtians, we ſhould ſee God in the means. Thirdly, The proud opinion of merit, if any thing in the world, overthrows it; I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17340:12"/> beleeve any Merit-monger doth, or can think himſelf beholding to God, for any his favours beſtowed on him; for while he thinks he hath obliged God unto him by his devotion, how doth he not rather think, God ows him thanks, rather then himſelf any way indebted unto him? But that our hearts may the better be ſtirred up to the Duty, Conſider we, Firſt, our no-merits; our <hi>Merita malae;</hi> yea, how ſtained the very prayers we made were, with manifold blemiſhes, as doubtings of obtaining, coldneſſe of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.

This armes us alſo againſt that pretenſe of Papiſts, for invocation of God by Saints; we are not worthy? and with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we deal not ſo? yet God loves to be ſo dealt withall, he humbleth himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. and 113.6. And this ſhould teach the proud, and haughtieſt upon earth, to imitate their Maker, and not to ſlight petitions from meaneſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: in ſpirituall things it is true, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond, nor free, all are<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 3.11.

Oh duſt and aſhes, proud worms-meat, gilded pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, art thou more lofty, and higher then the Higheſt? Yet humbleth he himſelf to the cry of the poor, &amp;c. So let us go, and do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore will I call upon him.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> thinks himſelf much obliged unto God, becauſe he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17340:14"/> would vouchſafe him audience. Is it not then a ſtrange inverſion Romaniſts have made? God is obliged unto them, becauſe they pray unto him; ſo farre beholden, that for this that they pray, he muſt in juſtice pardon ſinnes, and accept it as ſatisfaction for other defects: <hi>Mentior,</hi> if this be not their doctrine, that praier is a work of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, making Gods juſtice amends for their other things amiſſe. I know what they talk of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe that is in it, and of the charity that forms it; but this I would fain know for my learning: Firſt, Who is it that hath benefit by our prayers? God, or we? Whoſe neceſſities are ſupplyed? Gods or ours? What, when we reap benefit by prayers, God<note n="*" place="margin">See Iob 35.7.</note> none, ſhall we think the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden unto us? Secondly, Who is it that gives hearts to pray? If <hi>Paul</hi> ſay true, we know not what, or how to pray as we ought, except Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8.26. Zech. 12.10.</note> Spirit help our infirmities; Who are we, that we ſhould be<note n="*" place="margin">1 Chro. 29.14</note> able to offer ſo willingly? ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and who are we, that we ſhould be able to pray ſo fervently, ſo devoutly, ſo faithfully? Thirdly, Nay, in our beſt prayers, are there not doubtings, waverings, wanderings, coldneſſe of affection, yea<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 64.6.</note> pollutions? and yet forſooth, God is beholden to us that we will pray to him, not we to him for his grace in hearing. Fourthly, Is it not <hi>Debitum?</hi> have we not a mandate to pray? ſuppoſe it be with greateſt devotion, with longeſt continuance, yet is it not commanded? How then, ſay they, we make amends for other ſinnes by praying? as if the creditour were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17340:15"/> to his debtour, for that he payes his mite, when he ows his talent.</p>
               <p>But we return to <hi>David;</hi> Not God to him for praying, but he to God is beholden for hearing; and ſo farre, as that now he bindeth himſelf to limit his devotion to God, ſo long as he lived.</p>
               <p>The queſtion a new is raiſed; Whether it bee lawfull to vow a commanded duty? Why doubt we? It is a duty to limit our devotion, our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to God, yet <hi>David</hi> vowes it; ſuppoſe you, he ſinned in it? elſewhere, he ſwears to keep Gods righteous judgements; did he ſinne, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogate? Surely ſuch vows have this good uſe to Gods children; they ever increaſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to performance, and make more fearfull to offend.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee the meaning of the words. Firſt, The thing he vows, is to call upon God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The continuance of it, ſo long as he lived. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in Scripture, is taken, Firſt, Tropically, for the whole worſhip, and ſervice of God, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Secondly, Properly for that Act of religion, which we call prayer; whether one, or both be here meant, is not curiouſly to be diſputed, though perhaps he means properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As long as I live.</hi> Heb. <hi>in my dayes;</hi> which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Iunius</hi> with more acuity, then ſolidneſſe, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the dayes of his affliction; as if <hi>David</hi> here meant no other dayes of his, then the dayes of his affliction; as he would make probable by, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.7. and <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.21. Better our Engliſh Paraphraſe; ſo 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.19.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17340:15"/> Is it not well, that peace and truth ſhall be in my Dayes? <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> What means he? In dayes of his affliction? Nay all dayes of his life: <hi>Iob</hi> 27.6. My heart ſhall not reproach me in my Dayes; What's that? Not all the dayes of my life, ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <p>But ſo doth <hi>David</hi> now to limit his devotions, this of prayer eſpecially, to God onely; that no other god, falſly ſo called; nor, I dare ſay, Saint, nor Angel, ſhould rob God of his honour. And ſuch fruit ſhould Gods favours have in us, to glue our hearts unto God; and to make us continue glued unto God without ſeparation; ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 4, 5. and 115.3. to the 12. verſe. Theſe reaſons we have. Firſt, That favours we have from God none other can afford us; nor Saint, nor Angel, nor Idoll, nor Devill; amongſt the gods there is none can do as thou doeſt; when <hi>Baal's</hi> prieſts are brought to tryall, how doth <hi>Elijah</hi> ply upon them? Cry<note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 18.27.</note> aloud, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he is aſleep, or in purſuit of his enemies;<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 63.16.</note> Doubtleſſe, Thou art our Father, our Redeemer, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be ignorant of us all. Secondly, Beſides, we know the<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20.5.</note> jealouſie of our God, how ill he brooks the leaſt lowring look towards an Idoll. Thirdly, The impotencie of all other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, whether reall creatures, or but phantaſmes, to help and ſuccour us, or to avenge their own quarrell; Will ye plead for<note n="*" place="margin">Iudg. 6 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Baal?</hi> If he be a god, let him plead for himſelf, &amp;c. Fourthly, Is there any more ready to hear? more mercifull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our miſery? more humbling himſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17340:16"/> ears to our prayers? they miſlead you, that would have you to go to God by<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 2.18.</note> Angels. Firſt, Where is your warrant? Secondly, Can they hear? Thirdly, Are they more willing to hear?</p>

                  </label> An exhortation, in no times ſo neceſſary, as in theſe ſo wavering, and beginning to halt betwixt the two opinions, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. yet have we <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> reaſon to limit us to our God, and his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Firſt, How many gracious deliverances hath he given us? How oft hath he made our enemies the tail, us the head? Secondly, How many prayers of ours hath he heard? in famine, in peſtilence, in warre? Thirdly, What wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peace, and proſperity hath he given us? and yet doubt we, whether we be in the right? I am not of their minde, who enſure truth of religion by outward things; I know the primary rule is Gods word.

I beſeech you, brethren, think upon this above all other duties, when I am dead and gone: Above all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ever were Chriſtian, never ſaw any more plentifull tokens of Gods favours, then we; if we ſhal now turn back to Popery, take heed leſt he make not us a ſpectacle to all the Churches of the world, as he did the Jews.</p>
               <p>Now the good Lord unite our hearts to fear his Name, to continue in the grace of God, to limit
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17340:16"/> and appropriate our religious ſervices, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that God, whom we have ſo often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented to be ſo gracious unto us, that by no impoſture of the wicked we may be drawn away, and fall from our ſtedfaſtneſſe. To him for his mercies in hearing our prayers, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

               <p>I'le tell you; I was in miſery inextricable, and he helped me. Three things we have here to be noticed. Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> ſtate, in this Verſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, His behaviour, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. Thirdly, The event, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Found me;</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.34. Now ſo calls he the perils he was in from <hi>Saul,</hi> and other perſecuters, by Metonymie of the effect; ſorrows for perills, becauſe they wrought in him ſuch Deadly, and Helliſh ſorrow, as in the end of the Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>But ſo ſee what ſtraights of trouble, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed ſorrows, and inextricable pulls Gods deareſt Saints are ſometimes plung'd into, ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.3. Children come to birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth; his whole Church ſee in like ſtraights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10, 13.

               <p>What Reaſons? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. There was a nearer cut into <hi>Canaan</hi> then by the wilderneſſe; and ſuch as wherein they ſhould not have fallen upon ſo many exigents, Red ſea, Famine, Thirſt, &amp;c. Why that way? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. the ungodly is ſo proud, he cares not for God, neither is God in all his thoughts; eſpecially when all things are proſperous, then flouriſheth this pride: That cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nature we have all in us, except by grace, and gracious means, it be reſtrained, or reformed: Marry when extremity of pain, and perill comes, as <hi>David</hi> notes of the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17340:17"/> as it is noted alſo of <hi>Manaſseh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. then they ſought God; ſhortly then, it was to pull down their pride, and to drive them to their God in true devotion. Secondly, To prove what is in their hearts, as it is ſaid of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that the word of the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 105.19.</note> tryed him; the baſeſt Perſian will be a<note n="*" place="margin">Heſt 8.17.</note> Jew to enjoy their privileges: and I doubt not, but there are ſome who endure ſome fight of afflictions, but when it comes to matter of exigent, and extremity, ye then ſee them to flie off from God, and ſay, it is<note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 3.14, 15.</note> vain to ſerve him. Thirdly, To glorifie his power, and mercy, and grace in their deliverance, or ſuſtentation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. to ſee a creature ſo frail, with conſtancie to endure fire, frying, ſawing aſunder, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. lie long as <hi>Lawrence</hi> and yet inſulting over the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Tyrants, and daring them to do their worſt; who can but ſay, <hi>Digitus Dei eſt hic,</hi> The finger of<note n="*" place="margin">See Exo. 14.13</note> God is here, and none but his? Fourthly, To teach us, ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> not to truſt in our ſelves, but in the living God; How loth is nature, how hard is it in grace, not to<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 3.5.</note> leave a little to our own wiſdome and power? that oft, till all other hold-faſts fail us, we forget to caſt our care upon God, or to relie upon him. The Lord to beat us off from theſe, ſometimes permits unto extremities.</p>
               <p>Take heed how ye condemn broken reeds,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                  </label> men of God in ſincerity for this; becauſe God writes<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 13.26.</note> bitter things againſt them, leſt ye condemn the generation of the juſt; yet ſo did the wicked in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.11. You muſt Know: Firſt, That Gods love is not known by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17340:18"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 9.1.</note> outward things. Secondly, And what think you of our Saviour, A man of<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 53.3.</note> ſorrows, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and who ſaw as many exigents as any? Yet of him proclaims the Father from heaven, <hi>He is my</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But, Secondly, is it not ſtrange, Gods children ſhould ſo judge of themſelves on this occaſion? Certainly it is true, what cenſure they would tremble to paſſe on others in like caſe, they ſpare not oft to paſſe on themſelves. Of all paſſages in the ſtory of <hi>Iob,</hi> that one thing wonders me; that with all the pleading of his friends, whereby they labour to prove him hypocrite, yet ſtill he maintains, not that he was without ſinne, but void of groſſe hypocriſie. Thirdly, Think not when thou comeſt to Gods ſervice, and haſt for Gods cauſe forſaken the world, as<note n="*" place="margin">Iudg. 17.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Micah,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God muſt now bleſſe thee in outward things, eſpecially whileſt preciſely thou keepeſt this way. Firſt, Where is thy promiſe abſolute, and unlimited? I dare ſay, thou canſt not alledge one. Secondly, Haſt thou a privilege above all Gods ſervants? or hath God, or will he for thy ſake make another way then by the Croſſe? <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. I know God is pleaſed to reſpect our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet without ſome afflictions, and perhaps exigents, canſt thou hope to enter Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? or think thou walkeſt with a right foot to the Goſpel? ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. Thirdly, Haſt thou not learnt, that God hath to this end ſanctified afflictions, to wean thee from the earth? or art thou ignorant of the ſinne, that hangs ſo faſt, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17340:18"/> preſſeth down ſo ſore? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Knoweſt thou neither the ſtubbornneſſe of thy Nature, nor thy ſtrong propenſions to evill? Certainly it is true, there are of Gods own, many, whom rods amend not, they muſt be ſcourges, yea ſcorpions, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I found trouble and ſorrow.</hi> The word ſignifies ſuch ſorrows as are uſually joyned with<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 35.10. and 51.11.</note> ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it ſhould ſeem then Gods Saints are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their afflictions, and they pierce them oft with ſorrows inexplicable; I ſpeak not onely of thoſe, which come as chaſtiſements, but ſuch alſo as come as trialls: <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 38.3.</note> weeps ſore, <hi>David</hi> makes his bed to<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 6.4, 6.</note> ſwimme, his ſoul is vexed, groans, cryes; in one place, he<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 38.8.</note> roars for the very diſquietneſſe of his heart.</p>
               <p>Reaſons are; Firſt, Though they have put on grace, yet they have not quite put off nature; ſtrong<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> cryes, and tears, we read even of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and of his ſoul, that it was<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26.38.</note> ſorrowfull unto death; he fears, and mourns, yet without ſinne: The fear of death, and ſorrow is naturall, yea according to rectitude of Nature. Secondly, Though they know God cannot hate his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet they know, he may be, and is oft angry with his Saints: The Lord was angry with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> with whom he ſpake as a man with his<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 22. See Deut. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> friend; and whether our exigents come for tryall, or for chaſtiſement, Gods children cannot alwayes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern. Thirdly, There are infirmities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the beſt Saints; <hi>Iobs</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iob 6.11.</note> fear I confeſſe a little diſtruſtfull, in regard of Gods promiſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17340:19"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. yet ſuch blaſts, or blooms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, doth ſenſe of naturall infirmity oft caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Fourthly, Oft times in afflictions extreme, Satan, ſhall I ſay, or Conſcience, preſents to our<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4.21.</note> remembrance our ſinnes; and then if affliction be gall, and<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 13.26.</note> wormwood, even unto Saints, who can wonder?<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                  </label> Chriſtianity is not Stoicall, much leſſe ſtockiſh: if there be grace, ſenſible it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary rate even of a frown of the Almighty; but his word, his threat makes to tremble, the leaſt noiſe of wrath, makes them to melt, as<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 22.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> There is ſomething like pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is not ſo, we call it ſtupidity, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.3. thou haſt ſmitten, but they have not ſorrowed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.35. It is ſaid of <hi>Iob,</hi> in all this he did not ſinne with his mouth, neither charged God<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 1.22.</note> fooliſhly, but who doubts but the loſſe of ſo many children pierced him as a father? except perhaps we think grace makes us <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Two faults, or errours, come here to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Firſt, Of them that when Gods hand is on them by loſſe of things deareſt, pleaſe themſelves in this, that they are not moved with their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they feel not the ſmart of Gods viſitation; and herein they pride themſelves, as if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Iob</hi> himſelf in meaſure of patience; as if a man that had a mortified member ſhould think it his fortitude, that without ſenſe of ſmart, he endures the cutting, or ſearing of it; Nay, fear rather, leſt it be ſtupid; of ſuch patience he ſaid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17340:19"/> well, who ſaid, it was <hi>Virtus Aſinina.</hi> Secondly, There are another ſort of people, that when they ſee in any man mourning, or ſorrow, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo moderate, preſently begin to condemn of impatience, or to perſwade to patience: in loſſe of friends or children, monitions in this kinde, to keep a mean in mourning, I blame not; howbeit, I finde never any Prophet, or Apoſtle, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mourning, no nor lamentation, ſee 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. and ſee <hi>Ieremiah</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17340:22"/> he had experimented in his deliverance.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſenſe of the words; by Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of God, we conceive, that property of his nature, inclining him above our merits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our merits, againſt our merits, to do good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4. and 86.15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. Righteouſneſſe or Juſtice, that inclines him to give to every one what belongs unto him.

                  </label> None indeed ſimply ſo, and in reſpect of God, yet in reſpect of men, for particular faults; ſee <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7.3, 4. and 18.19, 20, 21. Our God, that is, the God whom we ſerve, taking it contradiſtinct to idols, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. Is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; the word ſignifies tenderly mercifull, ſuch
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17340:22"/> an one as whoſe bowels yern upon our miſeries; ſo propenſe is he to releeve them; by old <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> they are called<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 1.78.</note> Bowels of mercy.</p>
               <p>But in this paſſion of devotion, two things he commends to every devout ſoul, in any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath had of any attribute of God. The firſt is, Obſervation, noticing and obſerving thoſe attributes of God, which have manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the bleſſings reached unto us; or in any his operations towards the ſonnes of men; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.43. who ſo is wiſe will obſerve theſe things. <hi>Iehu</hi> no great good man, yet had his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the truth of God ſpoken by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.10. <hi>Know now that no word of the Lord ſhall fall to the ground, confer.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.36. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. he is in a long commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods grace towards him in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; in the midſt of it, he breaks out to this point of obſervation; Certainly it is a truth, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10.34. I perceive of a truth that God is no reſpecter of perſons. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 147. He bindeth up the broken in heart, he tells the number of the ſtarres. Why goes he not on in his numeration? Devotion wills him to notice this obſervation, <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power, his underſtanding is infinite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The benefits thence accruing to us, are ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two. Firſt, It is an excellent ſtrengthening of faith, concerning all truths God hath revealed touching his Nature and Will: ye may obſerve Gods owne ſervants ſometimes overtaken with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17340:23"/> doubtings of the Attributes of God; of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Grace, the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8. of his Truth, <hi>Ieremiah, Ierem.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Wilt thou be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto me as a Lyar, and as waters that faile?</hi> Of his Power, <hi>Zechariah, Luke</hi> 1. and <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 18. yea, <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had ſo often ſeen the power of God, yet at a time doubted, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.12. Here now hath Obſervation place, as a potent means to ſtrengthen our Faith.</p>
               <p>The Nature of God, and Concluſions touching it, we have delivered in the Scriptures, and had we no experiment, are bound to beleeve them: the evidence of all, and arguments demonſtrating them, we have in his works of Creation, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; ſpecially in the things that we ſee wrought before our eyes: To this end tends the Hiſtory of Scripture, and had we wiſedom, we ſhould obſerve in the daily proceedings of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards others, towards our ſelvs, what would ſilence the godleſſe thoughts of Infidelity. Juſtice, Trueth, Power, Mercy, Goodneſſe, &amp;c. we daily experiment, and yet, fools as we are, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not; No marvell then, if in time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation our Faith grows ſo languiſhing.</p>
               <p>A ſecond benefit thence iſſuing, is hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what ever good thing we experiment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe of God, See 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.36, 37. in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. and 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>David</hi> goes farther, to time of forefathers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.4, 5. And the reaſon is good, ſuch as the Lord hath been to others, to us, ſo will he be to us, if we reſemble in behaviour.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17340:23"/>
               <p>I ſay as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Oh that this people were wiſe; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                  </label> that we had all this wiſedome, to obſerve the Lords Actions, of Juſtice, Mercy, Providence, Truth, Goodneſſe, to others, to our ſelves!</p>
               <p>There lives not the man on earth, but taſtes all theſe in his own perſon; yet how few are they that obſerve them: So of Threatnings, Sundry precious Promiſes are given unto us, faith<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter;</hi> Not one, I dare ſay, but his Children rightly qualified have ſeen, or may ſee exemplified; That he will be a God to the righteous Parents, and to their ſeed, who can but obſerve? certainely, it raviſheth me to conſider; and though weak in Faith, and much conflicting with doubtings, yet it ſtrengthens my Faith, to ſee Gods Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others: So of Comminations for Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Whoremongers, &amp;c. I ſee it daily exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Why doubt I? But ſurely if in our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars we would be obſervant, we ſhould much more be fortified; <hi>David</hi> fetcheth it <hi>ab ovo,</hi> from his Birth, from the Wombe of his mother,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 139.13.</note> 
                  <hi>On thee was I caſt from my mothers wombe, thou haſt been my God from the wombe.</hi> I beſeech you be exhorted to this point of Prudence, beleeve me no more, if you ſee not Athiſme, Infidelity, Diſtruſt, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, Diſobedience, all evills die in you. Two things there are that hinder it. Firſt, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fortune in all theſe Accidents of common life, as if there were no providence guiding them; yet to a Sparrow our Saviour extends<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 10.29.</note>it, yea, even to<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 16.33.</note> Lots, the things moſt chanceable. Secondly, The ſecond hinderance, is the aſcribing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17340:24"/> the good or ill ſucceſſe of our lives to the means; if evil, to our imprudence or wilfulnes; if good, to our own wiſdome &amp; induſtry; whereas alas, What is our All, except the Lord give the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 127.1.</note> bleſſing?</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable in this paſſion of devotion is, the paſſionate, and devout expreſſion, and celebrating with due praiſe the attributes of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had experimented; ſo filled he is with raviſhment in the contemplation, that interrupts his ſpeech, he cannot expreſſe the benefit, but firſt he celebrates the praiſe of the attribute: like paſſages you may obſerve many in reading the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> ſpeeches broken, and ſeemingly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ſentence, and making a kinde of ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, when yet if you truly did underſtand the affection of a ſoul truly devout, you will finde them moſt pertinent. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5. The Apoſtle intends to remembrance the people of their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed change of eſtate, from being dead in treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſinnes, to ſpirituall life; the ſpeech would have paſſed full enough for the ſenſe, in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt commemoration; but mark how devotion interpoſeth, <hi>God which is rich in mercy, of his great love wherewith he loved us, hath quickened;</hi> like ſee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>The grace of our Lord was exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in faith and love.</hi> Do you ask me a reaſon of it? and I ask you, Why doth the Sunne ſhine? Why doth fire burn? No man can give reaſon of it: It is the nature of the creature, and this is the nature of devotion. Marry, if you would ask me a reaſon why he ſhould ſo do, I could give many, but it is impertinent to the point in hand:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17340:24"/> we handle not now matter of duty to urge obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but matter of property, that tends rather to triall: And ſo make uſe of this point, ſee how thou art affected, when thou meditateſt the many benefits God hath done to thy ſoul feeleſt thou ſuch motions as theſe; thy belly, as<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 32.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, is full as bottles of new wine, thou muſt ſpeak to the praiſe of God, elſe thou breakeſt, as <hi>Ieremie,</hi> I cannot hold, it is well, and I bleſſe thy ſoul; my belly, ſaith <hi>David, Eructabit,</hi> ſhall belch out thy praiſe. But on the deadneſſe of our indevout hearts in this behalfe! We can ſometimes ſpeak of the bleſſings we enjoy from God, and perhaps we ſometimes expreſſe our noticing the hand of God teaching theſe favours to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhew me the man of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, that breaks out into the magnifying of the grace, or mercy, or power, or goodneſſe of God: In a word, two faults I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this kinde in us. Firſt, That either we languiſh in the praiſe of the God that hath done ſo great things for us, and with a little bare lip-thanks paſſe over his benefits. Secondly, Elſe are not diſtinct, or particular in noticing the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall attributes we have experimented; me thinks, I would have a Chriſtian ſo skilfull in this kinde, that he ſhould know to what property of God he ſhould aſcribe every benefit he enjoys, every work, or operation of God to his creatures; in ſome ſhine wiſdome, in ſome goodneſſe, in ſome long-ſuffering, in ſome patience, in ſome grace, and mercy, in ſome juſtice, &amp;c. But the wiſdome of a Chriſtian ſhould be this, to be ſo diſtinct in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17340:25"/> knowledge, and obſervation, as to know, to whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attribute to aſcribe whether bleſſing: As in a body perfectly mixt, there are all elements, yet ſtill one predominant, ſo in all the works of God towards the ſonnes of men, Mercy and Truth, Righteouſneſſe and Peace, Wiſdome and Power, have their concourſe, yet ſo, as ſome one or other have their predominance: Let our wiſdome be ſuch in obſerving, that we may not let paſſe that ſpeciall attribute, without ſpeciall celebration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo doth <hi>David</hi> here, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in like ſort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. ſtileth the Lord, on like obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Father of mercies, and God of all comfort; As for example, In pardon of ſinne, there is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there is Juſtice, &amp;c. but the predominant is Mercy. Secondly, In crowning of our ſervices, there is eminent Grace and Bounty. Thirdly, In ſupporting in temptations, there is, Power, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Oh, we of little faith, why doubt we? have we a promiſe from God? and are we ſure, we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand it? and that we have our due qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification? Then we be aſſured, that heaven and earth ſhal paſſe, ere a title of that promiſe ſhal fall to the ground: God hath pleaſed by promiſe to make himſelf our debter, and the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our faith, hath exemplified his promiſe; and yet doubt we? Yes; For though to ſome we ſee them exemplified, yet as many we ſee deſtituted,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17340:27"/> and our ſelves experiment them not? With the limits intended, I dare ſwear, they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, if they have failed, we fail in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Secondly, We erre, <hi>Toto coelo,</hi> if we think all Gods promiſes are intended after the Letter, ſome are made good in the equivalent. Thirdly, We deceive our ſelves, if we think our habituall being the children of God, gives us title to the fruition of all his promiſes; there is <hi>Actus</hi> and <hi>Exercitium</hi> alſo required. Fourthly, How farre are we wide, if we think God hath not reſerved power to try our faith, and patience, by removing ſenſe of love, by writing bitter things againſt us? &amp;c. But rightly underſtood, thou haſt ſeen, doeſt ſee them all exemplified: And ſeeing God hath for this end exemplified, that he may confirm our faith, and expectation; The wiſdome that from hence I do commend unto you; is, Firſt, To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your ſelves with Hiſtories Divine, written for this end, ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note>

But is it a generall promiſe to all perſons, times, ſtates of the Church, not one but hath had, hath, and ſhall have plentifull exemplification? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is conſiderable the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the thing it ſelf promiſed; the manner may be ſeverall, when the thing is generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not all by miracle fed as <hi>Elias,</hi> nor as <hi>Eliſha</hi> by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels delivered; but this give me leave to ſay, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity towards any of Gods gracious promiſes, is fouler in us, then it could be in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarchs; What had they but bare word to reſt upon? Behold us compaſſed with a cloud of witneſſes, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to Chriſt, from Chriſt to this day; and if we now waver in faith, after ſuch plentifull exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our infidelity ſhall be moſt haynous. The ſufficiencie of proofe comes next to be handled, It is here from a particular example, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Is that true what Logick teacheth us, From one particular inſtance to conclude truth of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17340:28"/> Rule? Yet in Divinity it is frequent, from particular examples to prove generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions: Let us ſee ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1, 2. God hath not rejected any of the Jews whom he foreknew; How is this proved? For I alſo am an Iſraelite: Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. All that are juſtified, are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, How proved? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo juſtified; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to ſave all penitent, and beleeving ſinners; How proved? I a perſecutour, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, was received to mercy. And this firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds according to the Rule of Reaſon, when the <hi>Ratio formalis,</hi> The Reaſon of the bleſſing is generall; For example, Is this the Reaſon why <hi>David</hi> was preſerved, becauſe ſimple? Then from that inſtance follows the inference, All ſimple ſhall be preſerved. Was the reaſon of <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification, his faith? Then whereſoever is true faith, there alſo is juſtification, &amp;c. Secondly, We muſt know that Gods dealings are exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. Thirdly, God is no reſpecter of perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. He is rich in mercy to all that call upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12, 13.</p>

Firſt, It is more bounty to be kept from grief then from death, for there is a greater enlargement from miſery; but it is not more bounty to be kept from the ſenſe of affliction, then to be kept from death, which is the greateſt of temporall evills; but it is more bounty in a gracious eye to be kept from ſinne, then from death. Secondly, How <hi>his eyes from tears?</hi> If not kept from ſinne? That had ſure coſt him many a tear, as <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 26.75. But underſtand it <hi>De lapſu morali,</hi> ſo ſtill riſeth the gradation to enlarge Gods bounty; yea, which I count the greateſt bleſſing, in theſe afflictions he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17340:35"/> kept me ſteady in my courſe of piety, and ſuffered not afflictions to ſway my heart from him: ſtill in a gracious eye, the benefit ſeems greater to be delivered from ſinning, then from greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction; that is the reaſon Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.37. triumphs over all afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and 12. He counts them his glory, his crown; but ſpeaking of the prevailing of corruption in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, he bemoans himſelf as the miſerableſt man alive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is, for that rectitude of judgement is ſo farre vouchſafed, that ſuch men ſanctified, can diſcern twixt good and evill, twixt evill and evill; and in their eye <hi>Malum culpae,</hi> is greater then <hi>Malum poenae,</hi> The evill of ſinne, then the evill of pain; For, Firſt, That makes evill, not this; <hi>Puniri non eſt malum, comparative ſcilicet, ſed fieri poena dignum.</hi> Secondly, In afflictions they know they may retain favour of God, not ſo in ſinning. Thirdly, That oppoſite to increated, this to created goodneſſe; And beſides this, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having taſted the ſmart of ſinne in the ſoul (as who hath not that is Gods?)

The ſource of all ſinnes is this in the people, that in their ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity, and Epicuriſme, they will redeem the leaſt affliction with the greateſt ſinne; Rather then want, ſteal, kill, what not? rather then looſe life, countrey, liberty, commit idolatry, deny Chriſt;

               <p>Secondly, Try we our ſelves by this; I do not ſay all grace ſtands in this; for I know a naturall mans judgement may be ſo farre cleared, as to confeſſe,

               <p>THe Reſult of <hi>Davids</hi> Deliverance; elſe, as ſome conceive, a Promiſe, or Vow of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God for his great bounty towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Senſe.</hi> The reading may be diverſly conceived; <hi>I ſhall walk,</hi> ſo it denotes the ſumme of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or, <hi>I will walk,</hi> ſo it points at the duty. <hi>Walk before the Lord,</hi> Walking with God we read of <hi>Henoch, Gen.</hi> 5.22, 24 which the Apoſtle, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Septuagint, renders, Pleaſing God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. we reade of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God, preſcribed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the explication after a ſort ſub-joyned, and be thou perfect or upright; the practice of the precept in that ſenſe, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.40. by <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.35. <hi>I will build him a ſure houſe, and he ſhall walk before mine anointed for ever:</hi> that is, miniſter, or do ſervice, to mine Anointed, the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> in the Prieſts Office; <hi>Confer. Luke</hi> 1.74, 75.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the land of the living:</hi> Fondly do ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17340:37"/> here conceive heaven, or the heavenly countrey to be underſtood; and thereupon take occaſion Allegorically to ſhew that this earth is <hi>Terra morientium.</hi> Conſult with Scripture, ye ſhall finde it imports no more but this upper face of the earth, where living men dwell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; as <hi>Iob</hi> 28.13. where ſhall wiſdome be found? man knoweth not the price of it, neither is it found in the land of the living; that is, amongſt men here on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.5. <hi>David</hi> fortelling the deſtruction of <hi>Doeg, God ſhall take thee out of thy dwelling place, and caſt thee out of the land of the living;</hi> Clearly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.11. <hi>I ſaid, I ſhall not ſee the Lord in the land of the living, I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world:</hi> The whole ſenſe amounts to this ſumme; I ſhall live to do God ſervice amongſt men here on earth; and that ſervice will I perform in the uprightneſſe, and ſincerity of my heart; <hi>contra,</hi> ſee <hi>Iob</hi> 10.21, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.12.</p>
               <p>Which, me thinks, he utters with the voice of joy, and thankfull rejoycing, that the Lord had ſo graciouſly delivered him from thoſe deadly perils; for this end, that he ſhould yet live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men to do ſervice unto God.</p>
               <p>Notice it then as no ſmall bleſſing of God to have life prorogued to do good ſervice upon earth, whether in the Miniſtery, or Magiſtracie, or family, as a craftſman, or husbandman; <hi>For in all theſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24. <hi>ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things we may obſerve in the practice of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17340:38"/> Saints, ſerving to evidence this truth. Firſt, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wailings, and lamentations, when God hath threatened to take them away by untimely death; ſee <hi>David</hi> making his bed to ſwimme with tears, and with hearts grief pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed away with ſorrow in his ſickneſſe; Why? if ye ask, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.5. he ſaw he was likely to be cut off from doing ſervice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 34.14. <hi>Like a Crane, or a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo did I chatter, I did mourn as a Dove, Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Wept ſore, I ſaid in the cutting off of my dayes, I ſhall go to the gates of the grave, I ſhall be deprived of the reſidue of my years,</hi> compare <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond thing obſervable in their practice, is their earneſt deprecation of untimely death, and fervented ſupplication to have life prorogued; <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are full; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.23, 24. his wailing, he weakened my ſtrength in the way, he ſhortened my dayes; <hi>Then ſaid I, O my God, take me not away in the midſt of my dayes,</hi> let that wrath be upon my adverſaries; nay even when yeers were come upon them, yet ſome remains of ability to ſerve God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.18. <hi>Now that I am old, and gray-headed, forſake me not; untill I have ſhewed thy ſtrength to this generation, and thy power to them which are yet to come;</hi> ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve again, the joyfull thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they have returned unto God, when he hath pleaſed to renew hopes of ſurviving, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered it from the pit of corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Papiſts would aſſigne this reaſon; For that the bleſſedneſſe that ſtands in the viſion of God, they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17340:38"/> were excluded from, ſhut up in the ſtrait of Hell, wherein though they reſted from outward miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet wanted their ſouls the chief part of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the bleſſed viſion, and fruition of the God-head. Was that the matter? Yet were they <hi>In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerio,</hi> in a place where they received comfort, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. And of <hi>Elias</hi> it is noted, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into heaven, that he with <hi>Moſes</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto our Saviour at his Transfiguration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.4. who doubts, but clad with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory?</p>
               <p>Our people fancie another reaſon; and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth is, becauſe they had not in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that clear revelation of the glorious ſtate of Gods Kingdome, nor that plentifull aſſurance of their ſalvation, that we now have: And was that the reaſon they deſired ſo long to live? Firſt, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we affirm untruths, for had not <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> as firm aſſurance of the bleſſed ſtate of Gods children after this life, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rate of Gods people now? ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10, 26, 27. And ſecondly, ſlander the generation of the righteous; not becauſe they had leſſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love then we, but becauſe they had leſſe ſelf-love then we, yea, more zeal for God, and deſire to do good to his Church; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffering the reſpit of their own glorious reward, to the end they might, though on hardeſt tearms, bring glory to God, and do him ſervice in the land of the living; Therefore this reaſon themſelves give alwayes. Firſt, For that they ſaw the one half then of them, which alſo was made
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17340:39"/> to be an inſtrument of Gods ſervice to lie brute, and ſenſleſſe in the grave. Secondly, For that they deſired to benefit the generation then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to propagate Gods praiſe to ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſterities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19, 20. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. and 88. and 6. and 115.</p>
               <p>Beloved, Remarkable is Gods providence to me, in caſting me without any thought, or choice of man, upon a Text preſenting to my memorie, even according to the time, this great mercy of God to my ſoul, delivering my ſoul from the pit of corruption, that I might yet live to do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the land of the living. Worthy were my tongue to cleave to the roof of my mouth, my right hand for ever to forget her cunning, if I ſhould now forget, or paſſe over with ſilence, the great love God hath ſhewen to my ſoul, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it from the pit of corruption: O Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my heart to praiſe thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">At Briſtoll.</note>Even upon this day, according to the time of life, this time twelve moneths, was I in the jaws of death; none that beheld me, ſaw ſo much as the leaſt hope of life, my ſoul had not the leaſt commerce with the body, ſo farre as I know: Much about this hour, God was pleaſed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to look upon me, to ſhew me ſome glimpſe of his mercy, ſome beginnings of life, ſome hope that I ſhould walk before him in the land of the living: and hitherto by Gods mercy I live, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him weak, but hearty ſervice in his Church. Lord, what is man, that thou ſo viſiteſt him? Who am I, the leaſt of all Saints, the chief
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17340:39"/> of all ſinners, on whom thou thus magnifieſt thy mercie? What is that ſervice poor I have done? What that ſervice thou reſerveſt me to do? O Lord, be pleaſed to reveal it unto me, to make me worthy, by thy grace, chearfully to perform it: <hi>Da quod jubes, jube quod vis;</hi> for thou haſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſoul from hell, my life from death; thou haſt continued abilities, and opportunity, to do thee ſervice, to walk before thee in the land of the living; Bleſſed be thy glorious Name, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies, and God of all conſolation; bleſſed be thy Name for ever, and ever, and let all thy people ſay, Amen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Correct that errour of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein I know you pleaſe your ſelves many of you ignorantly, as if it were a matter of grace more then ordinary to pray for death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely in reſpect of the tearm of nature: This hold for a Rule; I dare ſay, it is certain; While God gives ability to do him ſervice, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or hath uſe of us in meaneſt ſervice; be it but, as <hi>David,</hi> to declare Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the generation preſent; as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the father to the childe to ſhew Gods truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. ſo long ought we to deſire to live; we ſinne, in wiſhing our premature death. And well weigh it, and tell me whether ſuch deſires, upon what ground ſoever, argue not rather ſelf-love; more love of our ſelves, then of our God; when God hath uſe of our ſervice on earth, to wiſh our ſelves out of the world. Who can ſhew me any Saint of God, in old, or new Teſtament, who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17340:40"/> ever made prayer to God, or approved himſelf in the deſire of death, when God had uſe of him here in the land of the living, without apparant fault: <hi>Elias,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 19.4, 14.</note> he indeed in a paſſion prayes unto God for death; and his reaſon mark, (which ſhould have been a reaſon rather to move him to pray for preſervation of life) becauſe now there was ſo great uſe of his ſervice for the benefit of the Church. That of <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 20. are apparantly paſſionate wiſhes of fleſh and blood, ariſing from diſcontent at their croſſes, which I think no gracious man allows in himſelf, or another.</p>
               <p>And make what pretences you will; I dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to evidence the prayers, the deſires are ſinfull, to wiſh death as long as there is ability, or opportunity to do God any ſervice upon earth, or uſe of ſervice upon earth. Firſt, That of<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob,</hi> upon this ground, <hi>I have not yet denied the words of the holy One;</hi> ſeems fair; neither can I blame his fear of his own infirmity: but yet there was faithleſneſſe in the wiſh, for hath not God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſupport? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Secondly, That of imperfection of grace, and ſinnes by defect in the ſervice of God, is as plauſible as any thing to legitimate the deſire; yet it proceeds from a falſe ground: It is falſe, that the longer we live, the more we ſinne; if we be Gods, the longer we live, the leſſe we ſinne; ſinne is mortified daily, and we bring forth<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 92.14.</note> more fruit in our age. Thirdly, That of evills to come, from which to be taken away aforehand, is promiſed as a favour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17340:40"/> and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. yet warrants not the wiſh: This let us be aſſured of. Firſt, Simply if we ſpeak; Proroguing of life to the utmoſt tearm of nature is the bleſſing; untimely death, ſimply conſidered, is the judgement; That it turns to a bleſſing is by accident, it is a bleſſing by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Secondly, I do not think but <hi>Iermi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hs</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was in the fruit as great as <hi>Ioſiahs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for though <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ſaw not the evill, yet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> endured the evill with patience, in the mean time did ſervice to God in ſuſtaining his Church; <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſiah</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to heaven, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his time. In a word, Some God takes away from evills to come in mercy, and favour, they are ſuch as he ſees likely to be overcome of the evills; in that reſpect he ſhews them favour; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he reſerves to taſte the evills, to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to his truth; To them this is a favour, yea and ſimply the greater favour.</p>
               <p>Is the queſtion, which is rather to be deſired?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Simply if we ſpeak, Prerogation of life; for that is natively the bleſſing. Secondly, For the compariſon, it is to be me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſured by the quality, and ſtate of the perſons; Hath God uſe of their ſervice upon earth? Firſt, They ought to preferre Gods glory before their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, They ſhall be aſſured, God will give iſſue with the temptation, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.13. Thirdly, Neither looſe they ought in the meaſure of their reward; as, according to pleaſures in ſin, ſo much torment; ſo according to pains in this life, is the meaſure of our glory.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:17340:41"/>
               <p>If you will ask me, how we ſhall know whether God hath uſe of our ſervice upon earth? Surely, The queſtion is obſcure, and curious; to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured onely by continuance of abilities, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, or calling from God: But becauſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; This rule walk by. Firſt, Though ſimply, if we compare ſtate with ſtate, it is beſt to be with Chriſt; for that is the end of our life, there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and conſummation of holineſſe, there is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for evermore. Yet, ſecondly, for thee, whoſe ſervice God hath uſe of on earth, it is better to live on earth the yeers of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> doing God ſervice, then to be whirried, as <hi>Elias,</hi> with chariots of Angels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into heaven: In heaven thou haſt thine owne glory, on earth thou promoteſt Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in the end, findeſt a glorious reward, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to thy meaſures of doing ſervice to God here upon earth.</p>
               <p>What then may we ſay of them, whom God hath taken away in the prime of their life, as that peerleſſe <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> amongſt the poſterity of <hi>David?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What? but what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Martyrs, The world was not worthy of them, that people unworthy of ſuch a pearl, a Prince ſo peerleſſe as was <hi>Ioſiah;</hi> for now the Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſseh,</hi> and the time of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance drew neer upon that rebellious, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying people. Secondly, Or that God ſaw their weakneſſe, and ſome likelihood of their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, therefore took them away by death, as <hi>Henoch</hi> by tranſmutation, <hi>Ne malitia mutaret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:17340:41"/> Thirdly, Or they had ſerved their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration according to Gods will, as is ſaid of <hi>David, Act.</hi> 13.36. therefore fell aſleep; or, as our Saviour, Had finiſhed the work which God had aſſigned them to do, and were therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away unto glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. they had finiſhed their courſe, and kept the faith, and were now to receive their crown of their righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. And yet it is true, while God gives ability, and opportunity to do him ſervice upon earth, while he calls us to do him ſervice upon earth, while he hath uſe of our ſervice of men upon earth; it is his great bleſſing to reſerve us to walk before him in the land of the living; to be preferred in our choice, before the haſtening of our ſalvation, and glory in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed be thy glorious Name, moſt glorious God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, for all thy mercies, for thy marvellous loving kindneſse ſhewen to me in a ſtrange city, in reſcuing me from the gates of death, and from the jaws of the grave, in love delivering my ſoul from the pit of corruption, preſerving my life to walk before thee in the land of the living. Lord God, What ſhall I render unto thee, for all thy benefits thou haſt done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for this unſpeakable mercy thou haſt vouchſafed unto me? It is little, too little for ſo great a favour to praiſe thy power, thy goodneſse, thy grace, thy mercy, thy truth; and my heart is too narrow to comprehend the heighth and depth of thy love to me in Chriſt Ieſus: even in this one favour vouchſafed unto me, Lord enlarge my

               <p>That might here be annexed; by all good means to cheriſh life, that we may perform the ſervice God expects from us.</p>
               <p>Scripture points us to four cauſes, or means of ſhortening life. Firſt, Immoderate ſorrow, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for things of this life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes the heart ſloope, Prov.</hi> 15.13. <hi>By ſorrow of heart the ſpirit is broken;</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17340:42"/> thoſe other groſſe crimes, for which God hath threatened untimely death; the blood-thirſty and deceitfull live not out half their dayes; either the ſword of the Magiſtrate ſeizeth on them, or elſe Gods immediate hand taketh them away, as we ſee in <hi>Abſalon, Adonijah, &amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, immoderate pining of the body; with immoderate faſting, watching, labour, though never ſo religiouſly imployed; ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p>If we follow the ſecond reading, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is here implied, it implies the promiſe, or vow of <hi>David,</hi> in thankfulneſſe unto God for his marvellous deliverance vouchſafed unto him. Wherein are three things conſiderable. Firſt, The act. Secondly, The manner. Thirdly, The mean. Firſt, The act is to walk, or to ſerve God. Secondly, The manner, in ſincerity. Thirdly, The meane, implyed in the Trope, <hi>Before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſo ſee we the generall fruit of all Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deliverances vouchſafed us, &amp; the duty we owe him in liew thereof; that is, to do him ſervice in that rank, or ſtation, whatſoever it is God hath placed us in; ſo <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſpeaking of the end of that great deliverance from ſpirituall enemie, it is to ſerve him in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15, 23. hence <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> acknowledgement, and proteſtation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>To fill up the meaning, that muſt be weighed; That the Lord expects, in reſpect of ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſpeciall ſervice; increaſe of our meaſures, according to the meaſures of our abilities: Ye
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17340:43"/> muſt underſtand, that there is upon all a generall obligation, and duty of ſervice that they owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; ariſing from benefits they enjoy in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others, as Creation, Providence, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Word, &amp;c. which bond, yet by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favours, grows more ſtrait; eſpecially when they grow towards perſonall, and we become af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort proprietaries in them: for example, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had a bond of ſervice, as heathen, from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Providence, but much more for the ſpecialty of Gods favour in their deliverance from Aegypt; wherefore that is prefixed as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of obedience to the Decalogue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. in ſhewing his word unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> his ſtatutes, and ordinances unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo is the bond yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20. <hi>Levi</hi> had yet more then <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> God had ſingled them out of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to miniſter before him, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.9. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he looked to be ſanctified by them eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. wherefore, ſee this a circumſtance of aggravation upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. that he rendred not unto God, according to the benefit done unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare the wonders he doth unto the ſonnes of men! Pſal.</hi> 107.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mention not to us of this Kingdome the common favours other Churches have enjoyed with us; the ſpecialty of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his Perſonall favour, <hi>Lord! how have they been magnified, and made marvellous upon us?</hi> How many ſtrange, little leſſe then miraculous deliverances God hath beſtowed upon us; in that Invaſion at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17340:43"/> in 88. from Gunpowder-Treaſon; It is our ſhame, and ſinne, that we have not in zeal for our God become preſidents, precedents to other Churches; yet would God, we had but equalled them, how ſhould I hope the Lord would ſtill continue his favours upon us!</p>
               <p>But what hath this wrought in us? but fearfull pride, ſecurity, licenciouſneſſe, even by that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that we have experimented the Lord to be ſo gracious unto us; as if we were perſwaded as Jews, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. either that the form of godlineſſe obliged him unto us, and the very name of a Church muſt link him to our State; or that his promiſes of favour were abſolute, without condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God binding himſelf to us, without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performance of our Reſtipulation: Nay, ſee if theſe favours of God have not turned to us as occaſions to increaſe to more ungodlineſſe; Do ye thus requite the Lord? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.</p>
               <p>Two things I propound to Gods people to be meditated, the better to ſtirre them up to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Firſt, There is no ſo firme entail of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to any particular Church, but that diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and unthankfulneſſe, eaſily cuts off: The promiſe to Jews, how runnes it in faireſt tearms of perpetuity; <hi>Here is my reſt, here will I dwell for ever,</hi> and that of <hi>David, He ſhould not lacke a man of his ſeed to ſit upon his Throne for ever:</hi> and yet is <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> now become heap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and that people have now long ſitten without a King, without a Prince; How ſtands Gods truth then? Firſt, It was meant with condition of their conſtant obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17340:44"/> And ſecondly, to the ſpirituall ſeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is this; The more God hath m gnified his favour, and mercy, to any people; in caſe of their unthankfulneſſe, he hath the more encreaſed their vengeance; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. He hath made the Jews an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an hiſſing to all nations, his mercies were not more marvellous, then now their plagues are wonderfull; and take we heed, it prove not our condition: God hath begun to plague the cities where his Name was called upon, and his wrath <note n="*" place="margin">Mic. 1.15.</note> creeps in the Church, as <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaks, from <hi>Lachiſh</hi> to <hi>Mareſhah,</hi> from <hi>Mareſhal</hi> to <hi>Adullam,</hi> the glory of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> This onely is the odds; they drank firſt of the cup of Gods wrath, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord reſerves the dregs, the bittereſt, and moſt banefull part for us; his hand is lifted up to ſtrike, and is yet ſtayed, till it be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted: but this let us be aſſured of; the higher it lifts, the heavier it lights, the greater ſhall our ſtroke be.</p>
               <p>It ſhall behove us then, to notice the ſpecialty of Gods favour, and mercy, to us, I mean our perſonall favours, our privileges; the favours, wherein we have had our propriety; That, if any thing, excites to thankfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Surely there is none of us but have our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, if not in the favours, yet in the manner, or meaſure, or means of convayance, I for my part can ſpeak it: This in ſhort let us notice, though for common favours, an ordinary meaſure of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17340:44"/> may ſeem competent, yet for ſpecialty of love, the Lord expects a more then ordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be performed: Oh Lord enlarge my heart, incline it to that meaſure.</p>
               <p>The manner follows; It is as before him, that is, as<note n="*" place="margin">See Gen. 17.1. Iſa. 38.3.</note> Scripture every where interprets its ſelf, in truth, in ſincerity, and ſingleneſſe of heart, which is the generall qualification of all ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, that forms them to acceptation.</p>
               <p>Thus underſtand, the Matter of all ſervices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto God, whether in common, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall calling, is the ſame, and they are, for the ſubſtance of the act, performable, as well by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, as by Gods children; The form or maner of performance, in ſincerity, is peculiar to Gods children; for example, to<note n="*" place="margin">See Pſ. 1.15.16.</note> preach Chriſt, &amp; to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the myſtery of the Goſpel; that is, of remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation by the death, &amp; obedience of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo doth <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo did <hi>Demas</hi> as well as <hi>Paul;</hi> but, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> they not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, as appears by their motive and intention; ſo of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 25.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Amaziah,</hi> in point of juſtice, and ordering the Common-wealth as a Magiſtrate, he did that which was good in the ſight of the Lord; here was his bane, he did it not with a perfect heart: They come unto thee as thy people cometh, ſaith the<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> Prophet, and they ſit before me as my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they hear thy words; yet do they but flatter with their double hearts, they hear, but will not do, their heart runnes after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe: What could <hi>Elias</hi> have done more then<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 10.</note>

                  </gap>, eye-ſervice; we read in Scripture of a heart and a heart, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart; in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> we finde a wo unto that ſinner that goes two wayes; the deſcription of an hypocrite; whoſe embleme is a Waterman on the <hi>Thames,</hi> his face, and armes, and whole body with full ſtrength is towards the Bridge, and yet is his courſe intended Weſtward; ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Come ſee,</hi> ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 10.16.</note>

               <p>The ſecond tearm is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the whole heart, which the old Scripture calls <hi>Cor perfectum,</hi> a<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17.1. &amp; 1 Chron. 28.9. Iſa. 38.3</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart; the meaning is, when the utmoſt of our ſtrength and endeavour in gracious abilities is extended to do God ſervice; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee;</hi> that howſoever there be, and will be defects in our beſt performances; yet we are able to ſay, it iſſues not from want of<note n="*" place="margin">See Heb. 13.18</note> will, and unfained deſire, or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17340:45"/> ſtrenuous endeavour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. but meerly from defect of ability.</p>
               <p>Evidences of it you may thus number. Firſt,<note place="margin">Notes of ſincerity.</note> When it is according to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. that there is not a duty, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of duty, which wittingly, and willingly a man omits; ſee alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. Underſtand it thus. Firſt, As farre as knowledge, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation goes, and opportunities are offered for their performance; the whole of mans duty, <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2. hath referred to three generall heads. Firſt, Purity. Secondly, Juſtice. Thirdly, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. In one of theſe all hypocrites have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in all of theſe Gods children are found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſtancie in Gods ſervice without defection, accompanies ſincerity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33. It is not the hypocrites flaſhes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. be they never ſo eager, and fervent, that forms our ſervices to ſincerity; <hi>Iehu</hi> drives in fury; Better the ſlow pace, ſo we keep going in the right way, and ſooner we come to our heaven; yet pardon we muſt all pray for, interruptions in courſes of obedience, as <hi>Peter, David;</hi> and for our ſtandings at a ſtay; for abatements of our fervour, when the temper of the Angel of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſhall, as not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, light on us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The contentment, and chearfulneſſe, and<note n="*" place="margin">See 1 Chron. 28.9. Epheſ. 6.7. Iſa. 58.13.14.</note> willingneſſe we finde in doing God ſervice ſpecially is remarkable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8.

               <p>Movites hereunto.

               <p>The Mean remains: <hi>Before God:</hi> Meditation of Gods Omnipreſence, ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. 1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.9. To ignorance, or unbeleef, or inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this principle, we may impute hypocriſie, all evills; ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.11. and 73.11. and 94.7.</p>
               <p>Thus for confirmation of our judgements in that principle. Firſt, Let us conſider Gods effects in his creatures; he hath given us eyes to ſee, ears to hear, hearts to underſtand; and can we then ſuppoſe himſelf void of that faculty? ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.9. Secondly, We are his workmanſhip; our thoughts and motions of our hearts are, for the ſubſtance of them, his operations; the ill application is from us, the draught is from God. Thirdly, His word in our mouthes ſearcheth to the diſcerning of the thoughts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. and this, me thinks, ſhould make an Athieſt ſay, God is in us of a truth; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. Fourthly, Our conſcience hath this power, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>How much more God, who is greater then our hearts, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Lord, Thou haſt dealt graciouſly with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and magnified thy mercy to us in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; pardon we pray thee our unthankfulneſſe,

The iſſue, or fruit of that Act. In the Act again we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 1. What it is to beleeve. 2. What it was that <hi>David</hi> here now beleeved.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Firſt, There is doubting, that is, when a man hangs in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> in even poyſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both parts of the Contradiction, as ſuppoſe the queſtion were, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> fell immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon his Creation? Secondly, There is ſuſpition, that is, When a man hath ſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beleeve the thing to be true, meerely out of the poſſibility of the thing to be, as ſuppoſe the queſtion were, Whether Chriſt ſhould have been incarnate, if man had never fallen? Thirdly, There is opinion, that is when a man hath ſome probabilities inducing him to beleeve the thing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17340:47"/> propounded to be true, as if the queſtion were, Whether we ſhall know each other in heaven? Fourthly, There is Science, when a man upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain demonſtrative proofs aſſents as upon certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Trueth of the thing propounded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the queſtion to be, Whether there be a God? whether this God be one? Fiftly, There is <hi>Fides,</hi> when a man firmly aſſents to the trueth of the propoſition, not for argument probable, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, but for the authority of the <hi>Teſtis,</hi> or witneſſe that doth ſpeak it; as for example, Whether God be One and Three? There can be no argument, <hi>a priori,</hi> brought to demonſtrate it, onely becauſe God teſtifies it to be ſo, Who beſt knows himſelf, and the divers manners of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Now, firmly to aſſent to this Article, is an Act of Faith.</p>
               <p>What was it that <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth here to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was, That he ſhould walk before God in the land of the living.</p>
               <p>The <hi>quaere</hi> is, Whence was this Teſtimony?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It might be, that he had, as<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his word from God, that hee ſhould live to raign over Iſrael, notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions of <hi>Saul;</hi> Nay, queſtionleſſe it is true, he had from <hi>Samuels</hi> mouth ſuch aſſurance, that he ſhould raign over Iſrael, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a Two-fold Teſtimony of God. Firſt, One is Verball. Secondly, Another is Reall, as for example, When the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt to the Gentiles, they teſtified it was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17340:47"/> he, whom God had appointed to be Saviour of the World; this was a Verball Teſtimony. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, But God confirmed this word by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by ſignes, and wonders, This was a Reall Teſtimony, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>But whereto ſerveth all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is well, if from this you underſtand the nature of Faith; wherein who almoſt erres not? not every perſwaſion, or firm aſſent to a thing as true, is divine Faith; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf before his Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. he thought, and was perſwaded he might do many things againſt the Name of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> according to that of our Saviour,<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>They that kill you ſhall think they do God good ſervice;</hi> And who makes queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but theſe all were lead by a word of God, ſounding to their apprehenſion ſuch, as carryed away their Concluſion cleare. I am perſwaded it is true, there is many a Papiſt in this Kingdom, thinks truly, and is throughly perſwaded, that all the errors of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councill are Gods Trueth; and they are not all ſo ſottiſh, but they ſee Texts of Scripture alledged to that end. And what can you think of Anabaptiſts, have they not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. to induce them to beleeve that Children ought not to be baptized? What of Browniſts? Have they not<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.17.</note> Scripture for their ſeparation? <hi>Tertullian</hi> did no wrong, when he ſaid Scriptures were <hi>officina haer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſium,</hi> a ſhop of Hereſies, if by Scriptures you underſtand the Scriptures taken after the Letter; for it is true, the Letter is often fairer for Hereticks, then for Orthodox Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17340:48"/> as that paſſage was for <hi>Arrius, Pater major eſt me,</hi> The rather is greater then I: I ſpare men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the errours of our own people; onely I adviſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Beware how you make ſcripture ſound otherwiſe, then the Inſpirer of Scripture, meant it; and this know, not every concluſion, or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that hath the Letter of Scripture fair, is Gods Teſtimony; but onely the Scripture taken in true ſenſe, after the intenſion of him, who inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſay as <hi>Moſes,</hi> would God you did all propheſie, and were able to interpret! But this let me tell you, it is fearfull taking Gods Name in vain, when men ſhall peremptorily ſay, God ſaid what never came into his heart: Said God ever, Infants ſhould not be baptized? It never came into his heart: Said God ever, that we may have no commerce with wicked men in word, and Sacraments? or that otherwiſe we could not be aſſured, we were ever taken out of the world; that is, out of the ſtate of the world? He never ſaid it, nor did it once come into his heart. Said God ever unto the people, It ſhall be lawfull for you to interpret Scripture publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or privately, doubtfull Scriptures, I mean? or, Did he ever promiſe, ye ſhould know what was concealed in them, but by your miniſters? He never ſaid it, it never came into his heart to think it: It was never Gods minde, the people ſhould be their own guides; for if ſo, he would never have ſent <hi>Philip</hi> to guide the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17340:48"/> 31. nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to teach <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. Think of it as you pleaſe, it is not my Popery, but your Pride to think, or do otherwiſe. Secondly, This well helps us to diſſolve the doubt Papiſts caſts on us, when we teach, that the Aſſurance we have of Gods love in particular to us is a point of Faith:</p>
               <p>They ask, Where is our Word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which many things might be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Firſt, That we have a word Intentionally particular, as when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>

                  <hi>you were the Promiſes made,</hi> it is all one as if he had ſaid to thee, and thee. Secondly, <hi>Generale applicatum ad hunc &amp; hunc</hi> is aequipollent to a particular, as when they in their penetentiall <hi>Forum</hi> ſay, <hi>abſolvo te,</hi> ſo we when by Sacraments we apply the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall promiſe. Thirdly, Gods Teſtimony is not all Vocall, there is a reall Teſtimony Gods work in us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. He that beleeveth in the Sonne of God hath this witneſſe in himſelf, his very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the impreſſion of Faith on his ſoul, is Gods Teſtimony; wherefore ſuch are ſaid to be ſealed by the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.</p>

               <p>How farre we ſtand bound to the performance, is matter of profitable enquiry, and in theſe times (though peaceable) ſomething neceſſary?</p>
               <p>This is the Reſolution for the generall. Firſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17340:49"/> It being a precept affirmative, though it binds <hi>ſemper,</hi> yet it binds not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> nor is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation to be actually performed; ſave only <hi>pro loco, &amp; tempore;</hi> ſuppoſe when it draws with it neglect of honour due to God, or edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; furtherance in faith to brethren. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept touching confeſſion is two wayes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Firſt,<note place="margin">Conſule <hi>2</hi> Theſ. pag. <hi>71, 72, 73.</hi> &amp; in cap. <hi>1.</hi> v. <hi>11</hi>
                  </note> Negatively, binding not to deny. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Affirmatively, binding to confeſſe. Not to deny the faith at any time, we are bound at all times upon pain of damnation; whether this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall be by words, or deeds, or ſignes; Chriſt thunders, ſpeaks not, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26. Secondly, The tears were bitter which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wept after this ſinne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. Thirdly, Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in all times ſevere againſt it, admitting none to reconciliation, but after tedious, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome penance. Fourthly, No marvell, for that is <hi>ſimpliciter, &amp; ex ſe malum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, when, or in what caſe we are bound to actuall, and open confeſſion of faith upon pain of damnation, (I ſuppoſe in times of perſecution) is matter of difficult reſolution: Rules herein ſome thus aſſigne: Such confeſſion is ſometimes an act of religion, as when without it the honour due to God, and his truth, ſhould fall to the ground, then a duty to confeſſe. Secondly, Of duty, either by courage to win an alien, or confirm a weakling, or to prevent apoſtacie of the wavering; then a duty to confeſſe. Thirdly, Of juſtice, in reſpect of the perſon a man ſuſtains, or office he bears, ſuppoſe of a Paſtour, or Teacher in the Church;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17340:49"/> then a duty to confeſſe: Howbeit, when religion, or charity, or juſtice binde to confeſſe, they leave us to the dictate of prudence.</p>
               <p>We have a more ſure word of propheſie, to which we ſhall do well to attend; That one Text in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> as to my apprehenſion it (ſounds) ſpeaks more fully to guide us, then all the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous writings of their Angelicall, and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Doctours; <hi>Be ready alwayes, &amp;c.</hi> Rules theſe; Firſt, <hi>Secundum animi praeparationem,</hi> The precept of confeſſion binds all, ſo that we muſt be ready at all times to make confeſſion of faith, when God calls thereto; yea, though death ſtand ready to deterre us; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>Take up the Croſse daily;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>Die daily.</hi> Secondly, When actuall confeſſion is neceſſary, as when our confeſſion puts on the nature of an Apologie, or neceſſary defence, and juſtification of truth exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by oppoſitions, and calumnies of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or is endangered to ſuppreſſion by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of perſecution; then ſay the Lord calls thee to confeſſe thy faith, then think a wo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing not onely to the denyer, but even to the betrayer of the faith. Thirdly, Eſpecially, if there be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that of authority interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, or elſe, of neceſſity begs of thee an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of thine underſtanding, and credulity in the myſtery of faith in Chriſt. Other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions here alſo fall in to be diſcuſſed as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this purpoſe; As, Firſt, Whether it may not be lawfull to conceal our faith in times of danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, whether it be lawfull to flie in times

For the plenary reſolution of each whereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their ſeverall applications, I remit the Reader to my Notes upon the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. where theſe queſtions are purpoſely, and upon ſomewhat like occaſion, largely diſcuſſed, and reſolved.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17340:51"/> afflictions have had in men moſt renowned, <hi>Iob, Ieremie, Peter,</hi> many other ſervants of God, Scripture hiſtories abundantly teach you.</p>
               <p>Reaſons if you ſhall ask me, I can give none better then theſe. Firſt, Nature is fertile of all ſinnes; no ſinne, nor degree of ſinne, may ſeem ſtrange to us in any man, ſo farre as he is naturall; not blaſphemy, not Atheiſme, not infidelity; let it therefore prevail above grace, as oft it<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> doth, the beſt men will ſhew, what they are by nature. Secondly, Next, is divine deſertion, Gods lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man to himſelf, as oft in particulars he doth, ſo he did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. whereof if ye ſhall ask reaſons, take theſe. Firſt, To humble us. Secondly, To make us hold faſt by God. Thirdly, To teach us compaſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. Thirdly, What ſhould I tell you of the Devills ſuggeſtions, which as we ſeldome want, ſo leaſt under heavie afflictions, ſee <hi>Iob</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Marry, if you enquire of the occaſions, I can ſhew you many. Firſt, Overconfidence of our own ſtrength, by which occaſion <hi>David</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, his great trouble fell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. and by this reaſon fell <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 26. Secondly, Next, if not ignorance, (for ſo farre I am loath to charge ſo great Saints) yet inconſideration: Firſt, Of the manner of convaying promiſes, whether tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or ſpirituall, or eternall, which are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but conditionall; yea, even in ſpiritualls tied to means; and with reſervation of power to the promiſer to chaſten, try, manifeſt grace, &amp;c. Secondly, Of the ſtrange means by which God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17340:52"/> brings his purpoſes to paſſe, even by ſuch oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times which ſeem to overthrow the promiſe, and to croſſe the performance of it; as when <hi>David</hi> hath promiſe of the kingdom, what leſſe appears then a kingdome, in the whole courſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſo many perills he was plunged into? Thirdly, You may obſerve to be giving leave to reaſon to overſway in deciſion of things, which are but meerly upon faith, and power of the promiſer; ſo <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi> fell upon their fidelity; ſhe laughing at the promiſe, he doubting, becauſe he ſaw all in nature againſt it.</p>

Yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from this ground, let no man throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into unneceſſary affliction, much leſſe wiſh, or pray for it; For, knoweſt thou what thy iſſues ſhall be?

Who bad, or warranted him to enter the high Prieſts hall? there to hazard himſelf to death; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.

Hath God made a promiſe in any affliction we ſeek, or caſt our ſelves upon, to ſupport us? Shew us that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and then inſult, elſe ſure we know not our ſelves; God who made us, knows us and our mould, it is his great mercy that he keeps us from temptations of our forefathers, for, a thouſand to one, but we ſhould periſh under them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Learn hence to moderate your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> in reſpect of Gods children, and their foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt falls; eſpecially, when you ſee great, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temptations preſſing thereto: Two faults ye ſhal commonly obſerve in men towards other mens faultings by ſuch occaſion; Firſt, That we are ready to condemn of hypocriſie, as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, and that for the ſtate of their perſons; or elſe ſecondly, marvellous rigorous and auſtere in cenſuring the ſinne, and then we cannot ſatisfie our ſelves in our Rhetoricall amplification, by all circumſtances of the ſinnes that they have fallen into; Oh that we could remember that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the fact none more then in other ſins; <hi>Davids</hi> adultery and murder is <hi>Quoad genus facti,</hi> all one with that of <hi>Am on</hi> and <hi>Abſolom,</hi> yet a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is to be ſeen twixt one and other; Two you have here expreſſed; Firſt, It is not a light affliction that occaſions Gods Saints to doubt, or murmure, or grow incredulous: the devill was deceived, when he ſaid of <hi>Iob,</hi> that his loſſe of goods, or children, would make him curſe God to his face;<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>In all this Iob ſinned not with his mouth, nor charged God fooliſhly:</hi> But great, and violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, they work ſometimes ſtrangely, even upon gracious diſpoſitions; the leaſt loſſe alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates an hypocrite, if it be but lack of plenty, it makes them ready to devote themſelves to the ſervice of the<note n="*" place="margin">Ier 44.17.</note> Queen of heaven. Secondly, Their infidelity is paſſionate, and indeliberate, when paſſions indeed cloud judgment, diſturb me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, blind certified reaſon, then ye ſhall ſee they ſhew themſelves men, but give them time to pauſe, &amp; to debate the matter with ſolid judgement, that they are maſters of their wits, and paſſions are calmed, then they can ſay, as the Prophet, <hi>It is mine</hi>

               <p>It may be demanded, what moved <hi>David,</hi> or the Spirit that guided him, to publiſh this foul crime of himſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the generall, Gods Spirit leaving ſuch records of humane frailty in great Saints, aimed at, Firſt, Our humiliation, and fear; for if ſuch Cedars fell, ſuch prime Saints ſinned ſo fouly, ſhould we be high-minded, and not rather <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> fear? Secondly, Our circumſpection and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe againſt the occaſions; wherefore ye have uſually, together with the ſinne, the occaſion no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how they fell; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> through his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; <hi>David</hi> by precipitancie, and paſſion here, elſewhere by idleneſſe into luxury, by luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie into cruelty; note we it againſt like occaſions. Thirdly, God would let us ſee what we are by nature the beſt of us, when we are left to our ſelves, ſecured from no ſinne, be it never ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, or abominable; not from infidelity, not from blaſphemy, &amp;c. Fourthly, Even by this he would teach us, that the juſtification of the moſt righteous is of meer grace, which as it is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we all carry about us a body of ſinne in this life, ſo of the falls of all Gods greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; wherefore I think it is, that men of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grace, have fouleſt falls noted of them, yea more then of meaner Saints. Fiftly, That humour of uncharitable, and mercileſſe cenſuring of our

               <p>But why the Penners of Scripture, ſuch as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was, did record their own faults with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and candor? Our Divines take notice of a ſpeciall reaſon of Gods ordinance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence diſpoſing in that kinde; to wit, that men might be aſſured they ſought not in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to advance themſelves, or as Politiques to captivate the people to obedience of that holy Doctrine they taught, out of their ſanctity, or dignity: For, would they then have poliſhed their own blemiſhes? But that indeed they were over-ruled by a ſupreamer power, whoſe glory they ſought, not their own, in penning the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for behoof of poſterity: wherefore obſerve ſcarcely any of the Pen-men of Scripture, but have their blemiſhes noted; <hi>Moſes</hi> his own, and his brother <hi>Aarons; Samuel</hi> the foul falls of his children; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his own detracting; <hi>Ieremie</hi> his own curſing his birth; <hi>Amos</hi> his mean education; <hi>Matthew</hi> his Publicaniſme; <hi>Paul</hi> his perſecution; <hi>David</hi> here his infidelity, elſewhere, his leſſe then blaſphemy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. Are theſe the courſes of Politicians? See heatheniſh Law-givers, how deſirous they were to ſeem petty gods?</p>
               <p>But ſo, even from this argument, which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf natively affords, may we help and cure our infidelity, touching the queſtion ſo much controverted, whether Scriptures were inſpired
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17340:54"/> from God? I confeſſe, no man ſhall have firm perſwaſion of the Divine Authour of them, but by the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6. That is, by the holy impreſſions which by this Doctrine he faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens upon our ſouls; for it is no vocall, but a reall teſtimony; yet are there arguments alſo from conſent, antiquity, fulfilling of propheſies, &amp;c. of no ſmall force to work conviction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth his infidelity iſſued anſwerable from his violent paſſion; Take heed of paſſions haſty, and unadviſed reſolutions, whither may they carry us? Who knowes? To infidelity, to uncharitableneſſe, to caſting off of humanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>A wiſe man will ſtabliſh his thoughts by Counſell:</hi> Now unadviſed reſolutions are in two ſenſes named, as there is a twofold ground for counſell to direct it ſelf by. Firſt, The one is, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, Fleſh and blood, carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereon a man deliberating, ſhall finde a ground for the corrupteſt action to warrant, and encourage to it. Secondly, Now <hi>David</hi> he tells us of another Rule; <hi>Thy ſtatutes are the men of my Councell, Pſa.</hi> 119.24. Now thus think, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to fleſh and blood they may ſeem advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſolutions; yet think, if they be not in their, Firſt, Matter. Secondly, Meaſure. Thirdly, Manner of carriage ſubject to Gods Law, they are in Religion unadviſed reſolutions, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Yea, be they never ſo wiſe, yet ſo farre as they are not guided by religion, they are unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they are fooliſh: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul? is there no end of thy ſorrow?</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:17340:55"/> This makes it Carnall, and take heed it occaſion not more croſſes. <hi>Ionah</hi> 4.4. When <hi>Ionah</hi> was ſo over-angry for Gods ſparing <hi>Nineveh,</hi> ſaith God unto him, <hi>Doeſt thou well to be angry?</hi> It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Anger: It ſeemed an adviſed perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which the elder brother would have faſtned upon his father, Reaſon he had for it, He hath ſpent thy living with Harlots; It is true, yea, but he is a Penitent, is it not meet then we ſhould joy? <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. I love not to particularize, I know not what warrant I have for it; but this let me ſay, Whatſoever affection of wrath, or love, or Grief, is not in the ground and meaſure of it ſubject to the law of God, that's unadviſed; Whatſoever reſolution, ſeem it never ſo warrantable in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is not ſubject to the Law of God, that's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and to be reputed as fooliſh, and unadviſed. Not to accept ſubmiſſion of a Penitent, not to joy in his penitency, (which Angels, and Saints, yea, God himſelf doth) not to notice the leaſt degree of Grace, (and for it to thank God) not to cheriſh that Grace by all means, be it never ſo little, &amp;c.

               <p>The Conveyance is in a Rhetoricall conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or deliberation with himſelf, as a man at a ſtand, or in a muſe, ſeeing his many obligations to God by ſuch favours vouchſafed, yet not able to recompenſe; ſomething he knew muſt be done; What he ſhould doe as beſt pleaſing to God, he ſtudies and deliberates with himſelf, and at laſt reſolves.</p>

Owe we nothing to our God, for the marvellous deliverance of our brethren, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſouls from peſtilence, Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing due to our God? Not ſo much as obedience? Not ſo much as mending what is amiſſe? Not ſo much as parting with the momentany pleaſures of ſinne? Yet, well fare the old heathen! And I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17340:56"/> am perſwaded they ſhall riſe up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and ſhall condemn us; there was not a victory, or a deliverance, but wrung from them a ſacrifice to thoſe idols, which they adored as God, Chriſtians onely forſooth, God is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity at leaſt, obliged unto, &amp;c. Looke you, Firſt, Congruity of doing good to the creature, in reſpect of God, ariſeth not from any thing he owes to the creature, but of that he owes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reſpect of his own Nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſay truth, there is no obligation of him to the creature, but what ariſeth from his voluntary and free promiſe; <hi>Promittendo ſe fecit debitorem;</hi> and whatſoever men, or Angels can claim from God, they muſt claim it <hi>Sub titulo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us weigh that the things which God commands us, or exacts from us, he exacts not for his own benefit; before ever man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was, he was God all-ſufficient, and he made not the world to acquire any thing to himſelf, which he was or had not, for he is <hi>El-Schaddai,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but to manifeſt, and to communicate his goodneſſe to the creature; and the end for which he commands, or exacts duty from us, is for our good, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. in keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is great reward; to wit, to the keeper, not to the Preſcriber.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this our want of rendring to God occaſions. Firſt, The diminiſhing of his bleſſings. Secondly, Yea, the utter removall, ſo we read how the Gentiles were not thankfull for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17340:57"/> the light of nature, therefore God takes from them very naturall conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Nay, uſually turns bleſſings into curſes, in ſtead of favours, powers down wrath, as on <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> You may not think <hi>David</hi> ignorant of that he enquires of; <hi>Moſes</hi> had long ago reſolved it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. and himſelfe here, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. ſee alſo <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6, 7. What then means the queſtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two things <hi>David</hi> commends unto us therein. Firſt, That in our rendrings to God, we ſhould not follow our ſelf-wiſdome, or will, but be well informed that what we perform, be accepted unto him: <hi>Saul</hi> profeſſeth to mean well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21, 22. when he reſerved of the beſt of the cattell for ſacrifice; yet for that he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his own wiſdome more then Gods precept; the kingdome is rent from him, ſee alſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12. ſo alſo <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Reaſons. Firſt, That may be plauſible, and pleaſing in the eye of fleſh, which is abominable in the ſight of God; as when the Gentiles ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſonnes and daughters to God, who doubts but by parting with things ſo dear, they thought to promerit God? Yet mark Gods Spirits cenſure of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. The things which Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice not to God, but to devills. Intentionally think you? By no means, but in as much as they followed therein their own, and the devills will, rather then Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, therefore they are ſaid to ſacrifice them to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17340:57"/> Devills. Secondly, You muſt remember what <hi>Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. wiſdome of the fleſh ſo farre as it is not ſubject to the Law of God, is enmity to him; and if there were nothing elſe but this, that it comes from his enemy, God accepts it not. Thirdly, Nay ſee how the Lord rejects ſacrifices which himſelf preſcribed; when in the manner of offering, they ſwerved from his preſcript, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. He that killeth an ox is as if he ſlew a man, &amp;c. Why? The things were preſcribed for the matter of ſacrifice? Yea, but they have followed their own wayes; ſee alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15. Who hath required theſe things at your hands? God preſcribed the things; yet in as much as they were not indeed in the maner that he preſcribed, they are as if they had been meer will-worſhip: of ſo much avail it is to be well informed of what God will accept.</p>
               <p>That I may not runne out upon this occaſion, to tax all that will-worſhip in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us be exhorted this to do: We have all in preſent been partakers of the bleſſing, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, of deliverance in our brethren, if yet the bowels of compaſſion be in us; perſonally, of preſervation, for God might as well have ſtricken us as them, as much merit in us as in them, perhaps more then in many.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we render? Is a queſtion meet for us? We may fall on that that will more provoke him; in that himſelf hath preſcribed, we may erre in the <hi>Modus:</hi> Two things therefore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to every man willing to be informed of his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17340:58"/> duty in this kinde. Firſt, That for the matter of his ſervice to be ſure that he hath Gods word for his warrant; it is not difference of meats, or ſtrict keeping of Lent, it is not numbring of prayers, &amp;c. Who hath required theſe things at our hands? Theſe have their place according to their kinde, and ends; but the main of all is this; Firſt, For the generall, break off thy ſinnes by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. elſe fear, a worſe thing will come unto thee, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. Secondly, Order thy converſation aright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. that is, in the actuall practiſe ſee thou conforme thy life to the Law of God. Thirdly, Serve him more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. It is one end of Gods afflictions, to quicken grace in us; think not the wonted mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſervice will ſerve the turn, but now ſith God gives thee reſt from thy troubles and fears, think he lookes for thy ſervice doubled from thee, if not in number of ſervices, yet in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of performance.</p>
               <p>But if in this bleſſing we would know what God lookes for from us; there is ſomething for the quality of the judgement, wherein we may inform our ſelves, both for the ſinnes, God would have us flie from, and duties he requires of us; God uſually proportions his judgements to the quality of mens ſinnes: Peſtilence a contagious diſeaſe; the breath, the houſes, the air infects them that come in it.</p>
               <p>What if this be one of the ſinnes that God plagues? Our neutrouſneſſe upon lewd ſociety with Drunkards, with Whoremongers, with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17340:58"/> leproſie it ſelf, nor peſtilence is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, yet will we into ſuch company? we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſport our ſelves with their ſinnes, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly we ſhall be plagued with their plagues; It was wont to be a ſigne of righteouſneſſe not to ſit in the aſſembly of<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 15.17. and Pſal. 26.5.</note> mockers; precepts I am ſure we have frequent, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. not to walk in the way with them, and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. not to bid ſuch, God ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Reaſons we have many. Firſt, They ſhall be <note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.14.</note> aſhamed. Secondly, Others ſhall fear. Yet herein faulty, do we wonder if God ſend pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence?</p>
               <p>Secondly, what if we ſay the ſpiritual contagion our ſelves carry about us, and have caſt upon our brethren occaſion it? If not in counſell, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, yet at leaſt by example; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</hi> I beſeech you, brethren, think of this, you eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that profeſſe the fear of God; abſtain you not onely from evill, but from<note n="*" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.22.</note> appearance of evill; hate you, not the fleſh onely, but the<note n="*" place="margin">Iud. ver. 23.</note> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ye are called to bleſſing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. Why then are curſes of plague, and peſtilence, wiſhed upon your cattell, your neighbours, your children, in your fury? Is it peſtilence, or plague, we would have? You ſhall have it, till God hath conſumed you from off the earth: theſe ſins break off, and think the leaving of theſe ſinnes God ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now requires of us.</p>
               <p>Would you know the poſitive duties God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17340:59"/> even from the quality of the judgement ye may be informed. Firſt, the publike ſervice of God in the Congregation, how generally is it ſleighted by the people? any occaſion will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from it. There was a Law for the Leper, He muſt not, till his Leproſie was cleanſed, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Congregation of Gods people; the ſame by proportion is juſtly holden for the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: I am perſwaded God aimed at this, That they that would not when they had health, might not in their greateſt Neceſſity approach to the Comforts that are tendred unto us: Think then the Lord ſpeaks to thee by this judgement, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 10.25. forſake not the gathering together of Saints, for there is God ſpecially, many times extraordinarily preſent with his Ordinance. Secondly, Chriſtian ſociety of godly neighbours is that the Lord hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for an under means to nouriſh, and increaſe Grace in his Children; Lord! how generally is it ſleighted? What through Pride, what through Malice, what through Covetouſneſſe; ſcorne we the company of Gods people? we may need the help and ſociety of the meaneſt: And think God by this judgement calls thee to the duty.</p>
               <p>Next for the <hi>Modus, What ſhall I render? Iſa.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Who hath required theſe things? Iſa.</hi> 58.5. <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen?</hi> The things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but they failed in the manner. The things I commend unto you in this behalf. Firſt, See to the ſtate and condition of your perſons, that you be truely penitent, and as <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 66.18.</note> 
                  <hi>regard no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17340:59"/> in your hearts,</hi> for beſt duties from ſuch are an abomination to the Lord. Secondly, See to this, That there be a concord betwixt thy action, and affection, thy pretence and intention: there is nothing which God more abhorrs then hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in his ſervice, for it is both contrary to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his Nature, and withall argues the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt opinion of God that may be, as if he were a God that ſaw not the hearts. Thirdly, Let it come cheerfully from thee, whatſoever thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt to God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>non quantum,</hi> but <hi>ex quanto;</hi> not what thou bringeſt, but with what good affection, and cheare, thou bringeſt, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; <hi>God loves a cheerefull giver.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> The ſecond thing <hi>David</hi> here commends to us in this his Rhetoricall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is, The nature of a heart truely thankfull: the beſt it can render, he thinks too baſe for the Benefactors to whom he renders it, ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14, 15. Firſt, If we compare what we render with what God conferrs; Heaven for Earth, Deeds for Words, Himſelf for Nothing, his Sonne for leſſe then Nothing. Secondly, If we way how in nothing we obliged him; for who hath given him firſt? ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. but onely his meere grace and mercy, becauſe he had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us. Thirdly, How ill we deſerved at his hands, having ſold our Birth-right, as <hi>Eſau</hi> for Pottage, ſo we for an Apple, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. Fourthly, How weak, and imperfect the pureſt ſervices are that come from us to him, ſtained as menſtruous Clothes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:17340:60"/>
               <p>Prove it as one maine difference twixt Gods true Children, and Hypocrites in the Church. <hi>Cain</hi> for forme brings an offering as doth <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4. but God had reſpect to <hi>Abel's,</hi> not to <hi>Cain's; Cain</hi> brings at adventure, any thing he thought would ſerve his turne: <hi>Abel</hi> brings of the firſt fruits, and the fat of the flock, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. The Table of the Lord is not to be regarded, Halt or Blinde, ſo it were a ſacrifice, all was well, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Who can in this kinde excuſe himſelf? The prime, and vigour of our life how have we ſpent upon the ſervice of Satan? our beſt wits how have we tyred and waſted in vanity? The Refuſe that age hath left us how hardly affoord we to our God? The Attention we yeeld unto Gods Word, is it comparable to that we yeeld to a Judge, or a Juſtices charge? The Threats of our God, do we ſo tremble at as at the Threats of Men? The kindneſſe of God do we ſo value as the favour of Men? we do not, ſuch is our ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, ſuch our more love of men, of our ſelves, then of our God, who yet hath done ſo great things for us!</p>
               <p>The better to enlarge our hearts to this duty; let us conſider, Firſt, That God hath beſtowed on us the choice, and prime of his favors in all kinds; As we are men, Reaſon; As his Church, his Word; his Word not onely purely, but plentifully prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; Yea, his Spirit, his Sonne, Himſelf: Thus hath he magnified his kindneſſe to us; Wretched men that we are! can we think our beſt Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too good for ſuch a God?</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:17340:60"/>
               <p>Secondly, Compare our ſelves with other Churches; He hath given us Peace, while they are turmoyled in the tumults of Warre; Victory, when they have been ſubjected to many Foyles; Security and Safety, while they dayly carry their lives in their hands; Liberty to ſerve him, while they many in corners are forced to ſteal their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: Thus hath God magnified his Mercy to us, and yet. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Compare our ſelves with our Brethren in our own Church, and Kingdome, we ſhall ſee God hath vouchſafed us our preheminence. It is well towards Thirty yeeres that you have had here the word of God purely, and ſincerely taught you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there be neighbouring Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſince the dayes of Superſtition never yet enjoyed the bleſſing to have a preaching miniſtry ſetled amongſt them; If we ſpeak to the Bleſſing in hand, Them God hath delivered over, us he hath preſerved.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Compare our ſelves with our Brethren and Neighbours living all under the ſame means of Salvation; How many ſee you ſtill living and dying in groſſe ignorance of God, in wilfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Diſobedience? And yet there be thoſe again that may ſay, God hath bleſſed the means of grace to them, their eyes are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee, their hearts affected to love, and obey his Truth. Surely if ſuch men can ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an ordinary meaſure of duty, I ſhall wonder.</p>

               <p>AN anſwer to the demand: <hi>Poculum Salutis,</hi> The Cup of Salvation; You may not think this to be our Drunkards Health; God never warrants either drunkenneſſe, or drinkings with exceſſe of riot to any, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. and yet I am perſwaded that profane Cuſtome hath originally grounded it ſelf from hence: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his time, ſpeaks of ſome Cuſtome they had to drink <hi>Pro Salute Imperatorum;</hi> but well converts it to <hi>Oramus pro Salute Imperatorum:</hi> The God we ſerve is not the Idoll <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to be propitiated with drinking, or drunkenneſſe; It is devotion and obedience that pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>I could fill you with Expoſitions, but <hi>Quorſum?</hi> This underſtand; The Jewiſh Church had three kinde of ſacrifices. Firſt, Holocauſts; wherein the whole was offered by fire unto the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts, nor people partaking in them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Sinne-offerings, and Treſpaſſe offerings, wherein part was burnt unto God, the reſidue was the Prieſts portion; Marry the Sinner or treſpaſſer partook in it. Thirdly, They had Peace-offerings, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.11. which were offered in liew of deliverance, and ſafety from God; Whoſe Rite was this, That thereof part ſhould be offered to God, part accrued to the Prieſts;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17340:61"/> the reſidue to the Offerer, and thoſe whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to partake in the Feaſt: Examples hereof, ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14. and, which is moſt to purpoſe, becauſe I think we have thereof what was done according to the promiſe here; It is ſaid of <hi>David, He offered Burnt-offerings, and Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unto the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.1.</p>
               <p>What is this to <hi>Poculum Salutis,</hi> The Cup of Salvation in my Text?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Cup of Salvation, is, by a <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> as much as <hi>Sacrificium ſalutis,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, A Sacrifice, or Banquet, made for the people in reſpect of ſafety, and deliverance vouchſafed unto <hi>David:</hi> read diligently the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Now if ye ask me the Reaſon of the Inſtitution, Why the people of the Jews muſt thus upon their deliverances offer ſuch Peace-offerings, and with a Banquet liberally eating and drinking before the Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, One reaſon ſeems this; namely, To ſtirre up the Offerers themſelves with more chearfulneſſe, and alacrity to praiſe God for his mercies. Secondly, If ye reſpect others, it was to teach what ſhould be the affection of all Gods people; that is, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.6.</note> To draw others to joyn with us in our praiſing God. Thirdly, If ye reſpect the laviſh multitude, I am perſwaded it was one end, that if by nought elſe, yet by the belly they might be drawn to know, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Name of God. From which ceremonious Ordinance, grounded upon theſe foundations,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17340:62"/> ſomething might be obſerved, which toucheth us: ye have been taught, that though ordinances of Jews binds us not in their ſuperficies, or according to the Letter, yet they binde accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Morall Intelligence; as for example, though we be not bound to abſtain from Swines-fleſh, yet we are taught by the Ceremony to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Luxury, which that Ceremoniall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation led unto; So though we be not bound to our Sacrifices of Goats, and Bulls, no not in Thank-offerings; yet to the Morall Intelligence we are bound: As this; Firſt, To ſtirre up our ſelves by all holy outward means to praiſe God with alacrity, and chearfulneſſe of heart for the favours he hath vouchſafed us; and that I am ſure is a duty, I mean not onely to praiſe God, but to uſe all good means to excite our ſelves with chearfulneſſe to praiſe his Name, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>This is that which the Rule interpreting the Commandments leads us unto; that is, Where a duty is preſcribed, there all holy means leading to the duty are preſcribed: as thus, To ſpeak <hi>Ad cor noſtrum,</hi> where it is commanded to provide for families, all holy means conducing thereto are preſcribed; becauſe the duty without it cannot be acquired, frugality therefore is required; ſo where drunkenneſſe is forbidden, company with drunkards is forbidden; where chaſtity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, abſtinence from laſcivious company is commanded; where giving to them that need, there labour is enjoyned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:17340:62"/>
               <p>We ſeem to love good duties,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                  </label> yet to be out of the love of the means; fain we would go to heaven, but we are loath to be ſent thither by preaching; yet<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> by it we muſt thither: Fain we would have preaching, but we are loath to afford the Miniſter his maintenance, it muſt be ere ye have it as ye ſhould have it: Fain we would have aſſurance of ſalvation, but we are loath to mortifie the fleſh; ſeemingly we fain to mortifie the fleſh, yet we are loath to pinch the belly or the back, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder; God never meant to beſtow heaven on us, or any thing leading thereto, but by means; I mean for that which is ordinary.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, let theſe Reaſons ſway you. Firſt, God never accounts that man willing to be ſaved, or to do any thing available to ſalvation, that refuſeth the means he affords to ſalvation; <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>I would have gathered you, you would not;</hi> Would not? who would not be gathered to God? But in as much as they refuſed the means, therefore, ſaith our Saviour, they would not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The means we chuſe may prove no means, but impediments; when God appoints the end, himſelf will make the choice of the means; but for gathering, and ſtrengthening his Church, he hath ordained Word and Sacraments, will we be ſaved without theſe means, we ſhall never be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Why do we not conſider the means may be taken from us? I know no Kingdome or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17340:63"/> Church in the world to which they are entailed: The Church of the Jews, thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> were Churches, as we are; ſo was that of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> yet now we ſee what is their Fate: Though God will ever have a Church upon the earth, yet hath he no where promiſed to have a Church in <hi>England,</hi> ſee <hi>Am.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Suppoſe the means ſtay with us; yet, Firſt, Upon our contempt they may be<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 6.10.</note> curſed to us, (that though we hear, we ſhall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) and become occaſions of our farther blindneſſe, and hardening. Secondly, We may be taken from them, by ſickneſſe, priſonment, baniſhment, death; and then what becomes of our poor ſouls? I mean ſtill, where we have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our ſelves contemptuouſly toward the means: This then I would adviſe, uſe the means which God hath preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>David</hi> according to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, draws others to joyn with him in praiſing God, we obſerve our duty, and that is not to content our ſelves onely to do religious duties, but to draw others to fellowſhip in them; ſo did <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Philip, Ioh.</hi> 1.46. ſo it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of the laſt times, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. but our times live to confute propheſies.</p>
               <p>We have theſe Reaſons. Firſt, Our reward is greater, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. ſuch ſhine as Starres.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They may ſupply our defects; all having not like faith, nor like fervency, nor like diſpoſition to receive; joyn all together we may perhaps make a complete ſacrifice.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:17340:63"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Compaſſion, me thinks, ſhould move us, <hi>Iud.</hi> 23. It is likely they that praiſe God for us, would more praiſe him for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Taxed here are. Firſt, Negligents in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who though for their own perſons they be carefull; yet for others are regardleſſe;<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> commendation was, he would charge ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children after him; His ſonnes we are, if we walk in his ſteps.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hinderers of the duty. Firſt, Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, Doing what deterres from religion, for whom, I may ſay, is reſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever, whether it be by counſell, or threatening, or puniſhment. Oh that ſuch would conſider what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Deſtroy not thou thy brother for meat, for whom Chriſt died;</hi> What doeſt thou but as much as in thee lies, hinder the intention of our Mediatour?</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay for example? though this I know, the exemplury ſinner is the moſt grievous of all ſinners; To him not onely his perſonall ſinnes, but thoſe which have been by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhall be imputed. And what ſay you to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of evill? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. if it be but connivence at omiſſions, certainly it ſuits not with that ſhould be in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you hither let us bend our ſelves. Firſt, We ſee Adverſaries, Atheiſts, Papiſts, all drawing to their practiſe; Shall not we be as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for our God, as they are for the Devill?</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſee the Devill himſelf beſtirring himſelf, becauſe his time is<note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 12.12.</note> ſhort; and how
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17340:64"/> ſhort our time is, who knows? once this we know, he that<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 11.30.</note> winneth ſouls is wiſe; and he that converts another to righteouſneſſe, ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 5.20.</note> ſave a ſoul, and cover a multitude of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we ſhame to learn of carnall men, or of the Devill, let us learn of God, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the end why he gives us gifts, not for our own benefit onely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. but for the benefit and profit of others, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 20.32. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next conſiderable, are the means <hi>David</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to draw the people to fellowſhip in his thankſgiving; It is by a Banquet: Me thinks he would teach us to draw any other with our ſelves, whatſoever he be, though it be by the belly, to glorifie the Name of God; and I aſſure you, I am of his minde, and dare avouch it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God: if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, when Chriſt was<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 1.18.</note> preached, whether by pretenſe, or in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I know not; but that we may ſay, ſo God be pleaſed, whether for a little countrey, or a great one: and if I be not deceived, this is the reaſon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth on us to do good to all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. and our<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note> Saviour, <hi>Let men ſee our good works,</hi> that if nothing elſe, yet the taſte of our table-chear may draw them to God; ſurely, me thinks, whether by the belly, or by the back, we draw them to God, ſo they be drawn, it is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; God drew the Magicians of <hi>Perſia</hi> by a<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 2.2.</note> ſtarre, fitting the means to their humour: Chriſt his Diſciples fiſhers, by promiſing a fiſhing of better value; and if we keep our ſelves to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17340:64"/> humour of the people, while the means are good, and the intention honeſt, what harm is it? our Saviour fits parables to this end.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſeem a fool in ſpeaking my minde, yet I aſſure you I ſpeak Gods truth, and no man can on ſound ground contradict me: Theſe outward curteſies that are common, and publique, I ſhould adviſe Gods people to ſhew as much, if not more, to Aliens, then to thoſe who profeſſe themſelves Gods people.</p>
               <p>My Reaſons are. Firſt, The ſlighting of them occaſions blaſphemy of the holy Name of God, as if we preached no Doctrine of humanity; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand relieving of naturall neceſſities, is a work of humanity, not onely of Chriſtian duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Reſpect to them occaſions their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Religion, the Faith that we profeſſe, ſo that without the Word, they are wonne by our<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1.</note> converſation: Underſtand, This is a naturall notice, <hi>Deus eſt beneficus, &amp; bonus creaturis;</hi> out of which Principle, Heathens can judge whether our Religion be of God, for true Religion fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions to the Nature of the God we ſerve.</p>
               <p>We love (I know not how) encloſures of our favours to them, who are actually the ſonnes of God; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> allows them to be prefer'd, but (if I miſtake not) he means in private, not in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, or common, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. I am ſure our God we ſerve, loads with his<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> temporall bleſſings the worſt men, and I know not how we can erre in imitating him.</p>

               </list>
               <p>What is a Vow? Generally, a ſolemn promiſe made unto God, with intention of obliging our ſelves to performance.</p>
               <p>There is, Firſt, <hi>Propoſitum;</hi> Settled and firm<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 11.23. &amp; 1 Cor. 7.37.</note> purpoſe of heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37. which place Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ill traduce to a vow; for though a vow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe ſuch purpoſe, yet doth not purpoſe make up the whole nature of a vow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Promiſſum,</hi> a promiſe, which adds to <hi>Propoſitum,</hi> obligation of the Promiſer; and may be either to men, or God; when it is made to man, truth is violated, if performance follow not; when to God, not truth onely, but piety is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Religion binding to performance; and of this nature is <hi>Votum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iuramentum,</hi> when to the promiſe an oath is added for confirmation, the Promiſer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging himſelf to God under the penalty of a loſſe to performance; now whether the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be intended to men, or God, the oath binds.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:17340:65"/>
               <p>Fourthly, There is <hi>Votum;</hi> wherein is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that made to God; for vowes and prayers have all the ſame <hi>Objectum cui,</hi> becauſe they are both <hi>Actus Religionis:</hi> ſo differs it from a promiſe generally taken, which may be made to men; To which if you adde the other two. Firſt, Solemnity. Secondly, And intention to binde our ſelves to performance, ye have the full and perfect nature of a vow.</p>
               <p>Kindes are diverſly diſtinguiſhed. Firſt, By their matter; ſome are <hi>Moraliter Pia,</hi> as when the duties are Morally preſcribed, precepted, here the vow increaſeth the obligation; examples we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God,</hi> ſee alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Thy vows are upon me, O God, I will render praiſes unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ask to what uſe ſuch vows ſerved?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are vertuous preventions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie in morall duties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Monitours, and excitements to more carefull obſervation: Thus it fares with us oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; our neceſſity, or perill, oft wrings from us purpoſe and promiſes of more ſtrict obedience; the ſtorm over-blown, we are oft forgetfull of duty; as Pharaoh, as <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the pious meditation of a ſound obligation by voluntary vow laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, layes on us a neceſſity of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; whiles we think, every omiſſion of duty becomes a double ſinne unto us. Firſt, By breach of precept. Secondly, Of Vow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are vows, <hi>Moraliter Impia;</hi> ſuch that of thoſe good fellows, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. who
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17340:66"/> bound themſelves by a vow, by a curſing to eat nothing, till they had ſlain <hi>Paul;</hi> ſuch frequent amongſt Papiſts, confirmed not onely by oathes, but with the ſolemneſt receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to murder Princes, &amp;c. In which perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances is double ſinne. Firſt, <hi>Factum impium,</hi> A wicked fact done. Secondly, Abuſe of ſo ſolemn an Act of Piety, to Impiety.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the old Teſtament were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of vows; of duties ceremoniall, as of Peace-offerings, Thanks-offerings, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things they enjoyed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. which the people, either in perills, or otherwiſe of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devotion, vowed unto God; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. with theſe in the New Teſtament we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yet ſomething we have a little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereto, which may lawfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently become matter of our vows; ſuch, I mean, as are made <hi>De Diophoris,</hi> or of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances in things that are <hi>De gonere bororum;</hi> as to give <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> inſtance; Suppoſe a man ſhould obſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf troubled with vain pride in uſing coſtly, or curious apparell; and to prevent this vanity, ſhould by vow binde himſelf to abſtain from ſuch attire; or if by the uſe of ſome delicious diet, he ſhould finde himſelf infeſted with motions of luxury, <hi>Nihilo ſatius fecerit,</hi> then by vow to binde himſelf to abſtinence; and to put this knife to his throat, as <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe is, if he be a man given to appetite.</p>
               <p>Like is to be thought of the vow of alms, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17340:66"/> conſecrations to be made to maintenance of works of piety, or charity, though no neceſſity to vow, yet lawfull, and in ſome reſpect obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and binding.</p>
               <p>Other diſtinctions of vowes there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Divines.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Abſolute, made peremptorily without any condition, expreſſe, or tacite; an example whereof ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conditionate, which binde onely upon ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Temporary vows, wherein a man bindes himſelf for a time, or times, to faſting, alms, devotion, in this or that meaſure to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Perpetuall, where a man bindes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for perpetuity; as <hi>Rechabites</hi> to drink no wine, nor plant vineyards.</p>
               <p>Is it lawfull in ſtate of New Teſtament to make vows?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some Divines have made it queſtionable: The more judicious, ancienter, and later, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe judge, with whom I conſent. Firſt, It is that to which there is a naturall inſtinct, and that univerſall, as to pray, give thanks, &amp;c. Secondly, Uſes of it under New Teſtament, as gratitude, firmer obligation to morall duties, prevention of exorbitances.</p>
               <p>Cautionate yet we muſt be all in entring ſuch an obligation: And thus generally are the Rules given. Firſt, That the thing moved implie neither impiety, or injuſtice, nor uncharitableneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:17340:67"/>
               <p>Reaſons are, Firſt, Becauſe to Piety, Juſtice, and Charity Gods law peremptorily bindes under the pain of eternall damnation. Secondly, Becauſe this croſſeth the maine end of a Vow, which is to obliege our ſelves more ſtrictly to ſerve God according to all his Commandements: I ſpare mention of the horrible, and helliſh vows of the Papiſts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have heard, and taken ſome ſuch from our people, that conceiving diſlike of the Miniſter, have vowed never more to hear him: Impious wretch! Wilt thou therefore neglect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Word of God, becauſe thou diſtaſteſt the perſon of the Miniſter? What a poor venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is this? And on whom falls it, but upon thine own ſoul? Thou art angry at the Miniſter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt put from thee thine own ſalvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Such that of many mercileſſe, and hard-hearted <hi>Nabals,</hi> who to ſave their Penny, their Crums; by vow binde themſelves never to lend, never to give, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. thoughts of <hi>Belial,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes:</hi> How dwells the love of the Father in you? how obſerve you the precept, <hi>Do good to all? Gal.</hi> 6.10. how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you the end of Gods larger diſtribution? Ye are<note place="margin">Luke 12.42.</note> Stewards.</p>
               <p>But ſure this goes to the heart; That in our ſelf-will, we either vow, or ſet purpoſe to reſtrain our ſelves from duties of Charity to which by inſtinct of Nature we ſtand ever obliged, eſpecially to the children of our own loynes: Let them grow, though in fervour of youth, to notorious exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17340:67"/> we have vowed, it ſeems, never more to admit them to ſociety, converſation, no not ſight, or conference: Have we vowed? That vow is impious; Have we but purpoſed? That purpoſe is impious, uncharitable, unnaturall; for ſhame, for ſinne alter it. Firſt, Doth not Religion, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Nature, teach a Parent to ſeek the ſalvation of the Child? yea, though exorbitant, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: How long bindes this Precept? <hi>Bring them up in diſcipline, and information of the Lord. Epheſ.</hi> 6. How long art thou bound Perſonally to apply Counſells, Admonitions, Comforts, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſo long as there is Hope, and that is as long as there is Life: Are we bound to it towards Neighbours? And not much more to Children? for ſinne and ſhame amend it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Hath God given them ſeeds of Grace? Oh for ſinne and pity water them; let them not by thy default die; diſcourage them not, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, But hath he given them repentance to come out of the ſnare of the Devill? How do Angels joy in them? how ſhould all Chriſtians rejoyce in it? moſt of all, Parents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. What grief like this? To think I am father of a Caſtaway, ſpecially when Conſcience ſuggeſts, I have faulted in duty, ſee 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Monica, Monica,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> mother, How did ſhe ſue him with Prayers, Tears, Vows to God? how did ſhe follow him from Countrey to Countrey, though a <hi>Manachee,</hi> a Fornicatour, as his own confeſsion is, till ſhe had procured from God his converſion? And what a worthy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17340:68"/> of Gods glory proved he? Certainely it is true, ſcarce any have proved more excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Gods glory, then ſuch as have been moſt exorbitant; witneſſe Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you take heed, when God begins to ſhew mercy, be not you unmercifull, uncharitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That they be of things within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our Ability, if not naturall, yet gracious: Reaſons are; Firſt, To vow an impoſſibility, what is it but to tempt God? Secondly, To entangle our ſelves in a ſnare. And thence is the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Divines juſtly take againſt the vows of Chaſtity in ſingle life, which they impoſe on all that enter ſtate of Religion; eſpecially upon their Prieſts. Their evaſions are, That they binde no man ſimply to enter ſuch Vow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſimply, upon an Hypotheſis; that is, if he will be a Prieſt, and in that office ſerve God, that Vow he muſt enter; be he never ſo well gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the work, be Characters of his gifts never ſo great, though God call him without impoſing ſuch Vow, yet he muſt Vow, or not enter. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it is poſſible by Grace, though not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as chaſtity in marriage, and other ſanctity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the <hi>quaere</hi> is, Whether by Grace common, or by Grace ſpeciall, and proper, or, as they call it, Priveleged? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith it is a proper gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. our Saviour, <hi>non datur omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> Secondly, They muſt ſhew that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven promiſe, they ſhall receive if they ſeek it; as he hath for graces of Chriſtianity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:17340:68"/>
               <p>Thirdly, That to any one perſon that for the time hath the privelege, God will continue it for perpetuity. <hi>Quid multa?</hi> How fearfull have the fruits been of ſuch interdicts? What are their Prieſts? their Covents of Monks, and Nunnes, many of them, other then Stews?</p>
               <p>And here by the way let me minde, and moniſh you, that you be not over-ventrous in binding your ſelves by vow to meaſures of gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, though in Chriſtian duties, beyond aſſurance of ability in the promiſe, or ſomething equivalent from God: Suppoſe a man ſhould by vow binde himſelf never to doubt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God; never to admit wandring thought in his prayer, or hearing, &amp;c. The vow were raſh, and may prove a ſnare to the conſcience; For firſt, Where haſt thou promiſe, God will give ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Secondly, Where haſt thou promiſe, thou ſhalt never conflict with doubting? never have thy attention diſturbed with wandering imaginations? The main of the graces for their ſubſtance God hath promiſed; the meaſure, and degrees, he hath kept in his own power to diſpoſe more liberally, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as he ſhall ſee expedient for every mans ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The third caution reſpects the intention, and minde of the vower, which varies the caſe ſo far in vows, that it makes them, and the offers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vowed, either pleaſing, or abominable in Gods ſight; though perhaps the matter it ſelf be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lawfull: as for example, to vow as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:17340:69"/> abſtinence from wine, or ſtrong drink, is not ſimply unlawfull; to vow abſtinence from ſuch, or ſuch a meat, &amp;c. not ſimply unlawfull; for they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things left to liberty to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or refuſed; and ſo thou mayeſt carry thy ſelf in ſuch vows that thy abſtinence ſhall pleaſe God; Is this that thou aimeſt at, that thou mayeſt prevent luxury, and intemperance? Thy vow is warrantable, thy performance acceptable: But doeſt thou think as Papiſts, that this abſtinence is warrantably a part of the worſhip of God? Thou ſinneſt in thy vow: For firſt, God hath no where preſcribed this as part of his worſhip. Secondly, And that minde, or intention, brought to ſuch things vowed, and their performance makes thee culpable of will worſhip, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Religion. Put it in a matter that is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of God as part of his worſhip; ſuppoſe in prayer; though thou voweſt to binde thy ſelf to ſuch a form, to ſuch a number, to ſo many times in the day, to ſuch a place, perhaps to thy cloſet, or to the Temple, Though to pray be a worſhip of God, though to pray in ſuch a form, or time or place, be not unlawfull; yet to think, that uſing ſuch a form, ſuch a number, in ſuch place, or time, is a worſhip of God, as it is done ſo, what is it but will-worſhip, and voluntary Religion? Laſtly, Particularizing in the matter of the vow, beſt ſuits with prudence. Reaſon is. Firſt, Becauſe generalities are more ſubject to errour, as being liable to reſtraints, exceptions, &amp;c. Secondly, Particulars are beſt diſcuſſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:17340:69"/>
               <p>Follows now the ſecond particular in this Text, the Act, or office it ſelf, Payment, or Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; <hi>I will pay my vows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if <hi>David</hi> performed? Follows it that we muſt pay our vows?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This muſt be conſidered,; the prime Rule of our Actions, is Precept, not Example; Though Saints, and Angels, ſhould practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to precept, their practice might not be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to us; for <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Secondly, There is <hi>Typus,</hi> and <hi>Archetypus.</hi> Paterns, are Saints and Angels; Archetypes are God, and his Chriſt; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. Be ye followers of God as children; Learn of me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p>The world runnes aſtray by means of example; Give leave therefore a little to enquire, How far Inferences of Doctrine, may be made from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? <hi>Manichees</hi> of old gave this Rule; That where were records of Saints practices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall note of Reproofe, there the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample either bound, or warranted: But <hi>Contra;</hi> for what if the generall Law were againſt it? though no particular reprehenſion; the generall ſhews, we are not bound, nor warranted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble; for example, when we read of Patriarks Poligamie, we reade not of particular reproof; yet have we a generall, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. God made one, becauſe he ſought a holy ſeed; and, <hi>Non fuit ſic ab initio:</hi> We read of <hi>Sampſons</hi> murdering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in taking vengeance on Philiſtims, yet may not inferre, it is warrantable for us ſo to do; though particular reproof be none, yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17340:70"/> is Rule ſufficient; <hi>Non occides,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill, another, much leſſe thy ſelf, For he that kills himſelf, kills a man, and by conſequent is <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Better directions are theſe. Firſt, What Saints did as Saints, that is, by vertue, and inſtruction of common grace, therein may a generall Law be made; Why? Becauſe therein we are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and for ſuch actions we have a generall Law; <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> obedience, &amp;c. We may imitate, for theſe things they did as Saints, as Chriſtians, &amp;c. Secondly, Some things they did by vertue of their ſpeciall call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Miniſters preached, Magiſtrates puniſhed with death, made war againſt common enemies: The Rule is here, Inference can none be made, but for men of like calling; Not therefore every man preach.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Acts of calling there are different circumſtances, and degrees; ſaith Saint<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> There are ſupreme, there are inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; not what the ſupreme Magiſtrate did, that may every man do that is in Magiſtracie, for ſome things are peculiar to them as Superiours; Amongſt Miniſters, all are not of one rank; There are<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12.</note> Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtours; Not every thing that an Apoſtle did, is warrantable for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſtour: For example, When the Rulers of the people inhibit <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to preach in the Name of Jeſus, notwithſtanding they<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 5.29.</note> preached; That is no warrant for us, for this was eminent in their calling, that they had it immediately from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17340:70"/> Chriſt, the great King, and Biſhop of our ſouls, wherefore could not be countermanded by man; we have ours by men, therefore according as men tolerate, or inhibit, ſo muſt we exerciſe, or forbear; Herein holds the Rule, <hi>Ejus eſt tollere, cujus eſt ponere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some things they did warrantably out of extraordinary inſtinct, as <hi>Phineas, Num.</hi> 25. as <hi>Elias,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. <hi>confer Luke</hi> 9. Theſe not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to us, except we are ſure of like inſtinct, and inſpiration.</p>
               <p>In ſhort; For the matter of example, and bond, or warrant from them for the like; Theſe two principall Rules remember.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Are they congruent to the Archetype, the chief Patern, God and his Chriſt, in things that are capable of imitation; therein be bold to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: For example, God doth good to good and bad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. So do thou to enemies: God pardons great ſinners repenting, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. as dear children herein imitate: God is provoked every day, and yet loads us daily with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>If ſeventy times ſeven times they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Forgive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule is this; Is the duty, or vertue, or action commanded, or warranted in the Law generall? Therein imitate Saints; Thou ſinneſt by bare omiſſion, thou ſinneſt more, if thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect excitement by their example; The Rule is Precept; Example is the excitement.</p>
               <p>To the queſtion now; Thus is the anſwer eaſie: Bindes it us? Yes, and the rather for the example;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17340:71"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> payed what he vowed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we muſt pay what we vow. Reaſon is; Firſt, So is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Precept, <hi>Vovete, &amp; reddite Deo, Pſal.</hi> 76.11. ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21, 22. and <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.6. where are three ſeverall reaſons to urge it.</p>
               <p>Admits the Precept no Diſpenſation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many things Popiſh Scholemen, and Canoniſts talk of diſpenſing with thus; and caſes they put many: Hold it for a Rule; Firſt, What thou haſt regularly vowed to God, no man can diſcharge thee from performance of; for by it God makes intereſt, and title to whatſoever thou haſt vowed, and who ſhall deprive him of his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? Secondly, Gods Law is this;<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 76.11. &amp; Deut. 23.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Vovete, &amp; reddite;</hi> Can man diſpenſe with the Law of God?</p>
               <p>Howbeit there are diſpenſations, or ſomething equivalent, which providence ſometimes caſts upon us; and which we may interpret as Divine diſpenſations: For example, I would ſuppoſe a man in his extremity of perill, or ſickneſſe, to vow reſtitution of what he had fraudulently gotten from other men; perhaps at the time of the vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ability is ſufficient; and event may come, by fire, or ſhip-wrack, that he is ſuddenly diſabled to perform what he had vowed: though in this caſe, it is meant; Firſt, The honeſt purpoſe ſhould be continued whenſoever God ſhould give ability, and make able. Secondly, Though a new increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for that croſſe accident preſently enſue not; yet whileſt the purpoſe is continued, though the act be not at large performed; howbeit pardon,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17340:71"/> we muſt think God in this Caſe diſpenſeth.</p>
               <p>Herein alas! Which of us muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay, <hi>Miſerere,</hi> Lord be mercifull unto me in this, That in our vows we are behinde with our God.</p>
               <p>There is in our Baptiſme a ſolemn vow made, to renounce the Devill, and all his works, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God, and to obey him according to all his Commandments: I diſpute not the queſtion now. Firſt, Either, whether it be a vow properly. Secondly, Or whether it be the vow of the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or of parents, children be bound: once this I am ſure of; Baptiſme is the entrance of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, wherein as God bindes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, under his hand and ſeal, to give us remiſſion of ſinnes, and life everlaſting; ſo we, by the very fact, covenant, and are bound to new obedience: And if not the ſureties, yet the parents are bound to, <hi>Quantum in ſe,</hi> that theſe things be performed by their children.</p>
               <p>And yet who may not remember, how his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, yea nonage much hath been led in vanity, diſobedience, and how the Spirit of the air hath ruled in him? It is enough, that we have viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Precept, it ſhould go near our hearts, that we have withall violated that ſolemn vow made to God in our Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If that may ſeem excuſable, becauſe not ſo perſonally made, and entered in daye of our nonage, what ſay we to the renewing of our vow, and covenant, at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? What time we thither preſent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17340:72"/> our ſelves, we are, or ſhould be men of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Maſters of our own actions; that we daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up bodies, and ſouls, and lives, all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be mortified, all that the faculties of ſoul and body will ſtretch unto, to be employed to the ſervice, and glory of God: And yet when ſee we in one of a thouſand, care to perform what we ſo oft have undertaken, and vowed to our God.</p>
               <p>Fools as we are; If God make not good all that he hath promiſed, for ſpiritualls, or temporalls, we are ready to quarrell, and grumble at him, and to queſtion his fidelity; who promiſing ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, performs ſo faintly: Whereas truth is. Firſt, God never promiſed abſolutely, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our obedience. Secondly, Hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then his promiſe, keeping touch with us, even when we deal perfidiouſly in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thirdly, And our own hearts examined, will tell us we have failed in our Reſtipulation: What if we periſh as our brethren, by plague, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, famine, ſword, is God unrighteous, or unfaithfull, that takes vengeance? We rather, who have dealt ſo treacherouſly in our covenant, ſeriouſly think of it, and now we are again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our ancient vow ſo often iterated, at leaſt bethink we our ſelves of our Reſtipulation.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeak of thoſe other particular vows, ſpeciall perills have extorted from us, in ſickneſſe, in other dangers? yet the ſtorm over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown, how have we returned as the dog to his vomit?</p>
               <p>The iſſues of men thus perfidiouſly dealing with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17340:72"/> God, ye may obſerve to be theſe. Firſt, God is made more inexorable in our greateſt Neceſſities, and then begins to laugh at our deſtruction, and mock when our fear cometh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. that though we make many prayers, yet then he hears not; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Commonly worſe, and greater cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities befall us, as <hi>Iob</hi> 5.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. There being nothing, wherewith God is more provoked then by being deluded. Thirdly, elſe our hearts more flinty, and obdurate in evill, ſo that we grow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate in contempt, and careleſſe neglect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our peace with our God; make but your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and tell me, if you finde it not true, that our Saviour hath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. The Devill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, after caſting out by vow, and promiſe, and purpoſe, brings with him more, and worſe then himſelf.</p>
               <p>The circumſtance of the time, Now, might not impertinently be handled; ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>I touch upon it onely: Amongſt the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our negligence, let not this be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; That whereas the vow bindes us from infancie, we have ſcarce in old age performed our Reſtipulation; and this account make, thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God will be from thy very Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>The third thing I rather chuſe to inſiſt on, is on thoſe words; <hi>In the preſence of all his people;</hi> confer <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Why doth <hi>David</hi> chuſe publique performance of his vows? Perhaps they were privately made, and I am perſwaded it is true, there were many

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not; vain-glory is when either by vain means which deſerve not praiſe, or when by good duties in themſelves praiſe-worthy, men ſeek the praiſe of men, more then the glory of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.43. otherwiſe, by holy means to ſeek good name amongſt men, with intentionall reference to the glory of God, is not to be vain-glorious, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>What then moved him to make this choice? Firſt, The good of men. Secondly, The glory of God. It is warrantable for a childe of God, to chuſe the publique performance of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or other morality, and to preferre it in his choice to the private: our Saviour ſaid not in vain, Let your light ſhine before men, and let them ſee your good works, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. Nor Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Shine as lights in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8, 14. to maintain or go before in good works; Nor Saint <hi>Iames chap.</hi> 2. Shew me thy faith by thy works.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are of it. Firſt, Our own fame, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The adorning of the Goſpel; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew all good fidelity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. To be faithfull ſufficeth thee perhaps for thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but it ſufficeth not for the adorning of the Goſpel; for as good not done, as not known done for that end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For winning of Aliens, at leaſt by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17340:73"/> way of preparation, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and 3.2, 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For excitement by example, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. neither is that true of Miniſters onely, but of the people; whoſe duty is alſo to be examples to the Churches of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p>Filfty, For ſtopping the mouthes of them, that are ready to blaſpheme, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>We are grown horribly wilde, and wanton in playing with Scriptures, and inferring from them, ſince God hath reſtored us liberty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves with the Letter; I am perſwaded God will one day plague it in us: For example, Becauſe our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cloſet,</hi> the inference is, Therefore no man may uſe his Private Devotions in a Publike place; Abſurd! I dare ſay, our Saviour never meant it, except S. <hi>Paul</hi> contradict our Saviour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Pray in all places;</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> her inſtance warrants the ſame, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. Secondly, May we give an Alms in a Market-place? I doubt not we may, and even affect, in Caſe, mens beholding of our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth. Matth.</hi> 6.3.</p>
               <p>For your better information; Firſt, It was never our Saviours intention to inhibite all publique performance of any perſonall duty, for ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. He would never then have ſaid, <hi>Let them ſee your good works:</hi> ſee the place <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. Firſt, <hi>Actus.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Aff ctus.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Geſtus.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Locus.</hi> Fifthly <hi>Finis,</hi> Thus conceive, when the praiſe, and notice of Men is made utmoſt end of our Devotion, and Charity, that is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17340:74"/> when we ſeek it as our reward, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand therefore that theſe are to be underſtood Comparatively; Rather Secret wholly thy Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Charity, then make mens applauſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intention, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29, 40, 41. Thinks any man, but a ſcoffing <hi>Iulian,</hi> that he is bound to the Letter ſimply, or onely comparatively? So true; ſo here, if we could be informed.</p>
               <p>I would I might perſwade you, to be thus wiſe in your choiſe of Times, and Places, ſo to do your good works that men may ſee them; let their loynes bleſſe you.</p>
               <p>I know not how we pretend ſuch declining of Vain-glory that we neglect the glory of God; and we are ſo loath to do our devotions, and good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſight of men, that we chuſe rather to omit what is convenient in Devotion, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If ever there were Times for Publication Practicall, now are the dayes; We have been long branded for <hi>Solifidians;</hi> and now, it ſeems, The Two Religions are come upon the ſtage, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which is Truer: Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his rule is this, <hi>Pure Religion is to viſit the fatherleſſe and widows, Iam.</hi> 1.27.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Actus,</hi> Obſervation, and inference made thereout; For the generall of obſervation, we treated it, <hi>ad verſ.</hi> 5. Marry there onely as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Nature of God, and verities delivered us concerning it: Here it is rather of ſomething that concerns his children, and Gods regard to them; wherein, if in any thing, our obſervation ſhould be curious; for that by ſpecialty God is their God, and his favours to them are all <hi>Cum Privilegio:</hi> Some favours indeed are common to his children with the world, as preſervation; but herein have Gods own their ſpecialty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Sunne, Moone, Starres, their light, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences he hath made to ſerve all nations: marry to fight for his people, as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.20. Privelege to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The works of God lie open to every mans view, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. But his word is ſhewn to <hi>Iacob</hi> onely, his ſtatutes to <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 147.20. To his Church viſible, and hypocrites therein,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17340:75"/> he gives his word, but to them moſtly in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; <hi>To you it is given to know the myſteries, Matth.</hi> 13. To ſome is knowledge given of his word, but through their neglect it aggravates their damnation, <hi>Matth</hi> 11. To his children onely it is Gods power to ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. Herein therefore we ſhould be ſpecially obſervant. Firſt, That we might ſee, and comprehend the ſpecialty of love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. Secondly, That our hearts might be more excited to thankfulneſſe; ſith ſpeciall favours require ſpeciall thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Beſides, temptations tending to doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do not ſo oft betide Gods children, either about his Nature in generall, or about common bleſſings, as about thoſe that are priveleges, and characteriſticall; whether God be Almighty, Juſt, Mercifull, &amp;c. in his own Nature, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo in thoſe graces that are convayed to them with a p ivelege, about Adoption, Regeneration, Perſeverance, &amp;c. This part of Prudence let us learn; Truſt my experience no more, if you finde it not extraordinary comfortable in the evill day.</p>
               <p>In five degrees ye ſhall finde all favours of God to ſtand. Firſt, Some common to us with all his creatures. Secondly, Some common with all men.

                  </gap>re wherein every of Gods children have ſomething extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I would have none of Gods favours put over without notice, and obſervation; ſpecially thoſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17340:75"/> that are peculiar to his children; leaſt of all thoſe, wherein God hath manifeſted his mercy towards us above his children, and own dear ſervants; becauſe for theſe God expects extraordinary meaſure of thankfulneſſe, and obedience; and the rather would I ye ſhould notice this, becauſe that moſt moves us in Chriſtian duties, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that we ſee not ſome ſpeciall reward twixt him that ſerveth God, and others; ſee <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. Speculative knowledge, I confeſſe, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gift of God, and neceſſary to ſalvation, yet we erre, if we think it ſufficient; ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. There are theſe evidences whereby you may judge of it in your ſelves. Firſt, What grace, or mercy, we taſte from God, we are propenſe to ſhew to others; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. In forgiveneſſe; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in patience, in communicating what our ſelves have experimented, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, Wonderfull deſirous of winning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to like experience of Gods favour, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. Thirdly, None more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of others converſion, be their ſtate never ſo deſperate for the preſent. Therefore is infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or doubting, of generall concluſions in none more tollerable then in Gods S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ints. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, Becauſe they have a furtherance to faith, which others want; to wit, Experience of Gods favour, and ſpeciall love to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> or ground of inference is his own experience, as if he had ſaid, Truly I may ſay it, for in mine experience I have found it, ſo oft hath he delivered, and reſcued me from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17340:76"/> the jaws of death: So pleaſeth it God, to give his children ſpeciall experience of generall docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Taſte, and ſee:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious: Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Knowledge and experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reaſons are. Firſt, To increaſe their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that though it be true, their faith, reſts principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Authority of the Divine Revealer, yet confirmation it receives from experience: That the word of God is his power to Salvation, is the document; and though there were nothing elſe but his Teſtimony, we ſhould beleeve it; but God makes it ſo to the experience of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they may be more certainly aſſured of it in their ſouls, ſee 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is in it a condeſcending to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity; Simple we are all by nature; and are generally inclined to walk by ſenſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. God conſidereth our mould, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. and therefore tempers his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to our infirmity, and after a ſort humours our nature in the motions of grace. This favour of God let us not paſſe over, without admiring the riches of Gods bounty to us; <hi>Lord, what is man that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> The rather, becauſe it is a teaching peculiar to Gods children; that though the generalls of Doctrine touching Gods Nature, and Will, and ſpeciall love to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, be propounded to all mens mindes in the Church; yet this experimentall teaching, in things that concern life, and godlineſſe, is the priveledge of the choſen; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.45. They ſhall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17340:76"/> be all taught of God, they onely in this manner; no men but Gods Elect have that experience of what God hath made ſeverall to his ſervants. There are two kindes, or degrees of knowledge; One ſpeculative, the other practicall, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; The ſpeculative ſtandeth in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; this had <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 23.10. thence grew his paſſionate wiſh; <hi>Oh let my ſoul die the death of the righteous;</hi> The all-ſufficiencie of the merits of Chriſt to ſalvation, wicked contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate; ſo of remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c. but the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall knowledge of all theſe is the privelege of his choſen onely.</p>
               <p>But note we how from particular experience he inferres a generall Rule; Will it proceed? God tenderly reſpects the life of <hi>David,</hi> Is he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo to all his children? Above in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of the fifth Verſe, we had an enquiry, How farre generall inferences of duty might be made from particulars; and the laſt Lords-day, how farre the ſame might be made from example; Now it is to be enquired, How farre generall Doctrines of favour may be made from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar experiments? Surely, ye ſhall finde it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Scriptures, from particular actions of God in patience, or mercy, or power, to inferre generall concluſions, ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. He ſaved <hi>Lot, Noah,</hi> therefore knows how to deliver his: He had mercy on me repenting, therefore will ſave all penitent ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. With Jews receiving Sacraments he was not pleaſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. therefore, may not Chriſtians preſume of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17340:77"/> favour, becauſe they enjoy the Sacraments; He plagued them for murmuring, for idolatry, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, therefore take heed of like ſinnes; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. He ſpared not naturall branches, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not thee, but fear alſo, not being high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thine own cutting off likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Cautions here are theſe. Firſt, Be ſure thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be delivered in the word of God, then ſpare not to inferre according to the latitude thereof; with God there is no reſpect of perſons, A concluſion in the word of God, I perceive it, ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10.34. All penitents ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. that's confirmed from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> experience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. Precious is the blood of Saints in Gods ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.14. from experience <hi>David</hi> affirms it: And this Rule well arms us againſt all Enthuſiaſmes, and ſuch like deluſions, wherein Anabaptiſts runne to the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Diſtinguiſh generall from perſonall priveleges; for ſuch ye ſhall read many in the word of God; <hi>Num.</hi> 12. If there be a Prophet, I will ſpeak to him by dream, or viſion, my ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> is not ſo; To be inſtructed in all things thou mayeſt expect, but to talk with God face to face, or to be informed, by dream, or viſion, expect not; To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. And, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. Prieſts lips ſhall preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where the favour is generall, yet the manner, and mean of convayance may be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: for example, to be fed in famine, is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17340:77"/> promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. but to be fed as <hi>Elias,</hi> by a Raven, or as the widow of <hi>Sarephath,</hi> by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous multiplying the meal, and oyl, was their perſonall privelege.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As in the <hi>Modus,</hi> and mean, ſo in their meaſure there are that have prerogative in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours; as in knowledge, <hi>Moſes;</hi> in faith, <hi>Abraham;</hi> in patience, <hi>Iob;</hi> in zeal, <hi>David:</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, <hi>Paul;</hi> A meaſure, except according to the promiſe of God, who gives to every one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally as he will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, In application of the generall in other mens experiments to thy ſelf, be ſure thou bring like qualification; It is true, God had mercy on <hi>Paul</hi> repenting, therefore he will have mercy on all, but repenting, &amp;c. Slight not therefore thine own, or other mens perſonall experiences, they bring great good unto much confirmation to faith concerning the generalls; in them we are grown me thinks too wavering: That is a true Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.18. Mercy ſhall be upon ſuch, as upon the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, yet it is upon ſuch as walk after the right Rule, That's a true Rule, God will provide thee competencie according to thy ſtate, and perſon, if thou keep his wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely; yet falſe weights, and falſe meaſures we muſt uſe; elſe how ſhall we live? That God will finde us a hiding place in the day of his wrath, is a true Rule, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. moſt plentifully we have ſeen it experimented, to <hi>Elias, Eliſha</hi> the Prophets under <hi>Iezabel;</hi> Why doubt we, Oh we of little faith? and our ſelves have experimented in many
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17340:78"/> particular perills, and deliverances, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and proviſions that God hath made for us; And ſurely, God is rich in mercy to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. and with him is no reſpect of perſons; His dealings are exemplary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. ſo we reſemble in behaviour.</p>
               <p>Follows now the matter of obſervation; It is enunciated in one ſimple propoſition, tending to explicate the eſteem God holds of the death of Saints, which ſome interpret of his Saints in death; Rather, of the death of his Saints.</p>
               <p>I could cloy you with interpretations, but <hi>Quor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum?</hi> The like phraſe of ſpeech we reade, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.14. Now whether he means their naturall, or violent death inflicted by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours, may be <hi>quaere'd;</hi> Rather this latter, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.14. <hi>Their blood is precious;</hi> to this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Text invite us. Firſt, Rarely doth God give way unto it; for ſo finde we the word Precious put for Rare, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. Never but upon ſpeciall cauſe; And this is that we have doctrinally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.14. He doth redeem their ſoul from deceit and violence, that neither ſword, nor cruelty prevails to overthrow it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.32. Wicked watcheth Righteous, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſlay him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 33. The Lord will not leave him in his hand. Plentifull inſtances we have in Scriptures, I could begin with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo hold on to <hi>Eliah, Eliſha,</hi> the Three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Fires action ſuſpended, and <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. Lions mouthes ſtopped; Beſides many extraordinary
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17340:78"/> deliverances of others in latter times, wherein the wiſdome, and power of God, hath ſtrangely ſhewed it ſelf for their deliverance, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. God delivered Saint <hi>Paul</hi> out of the mouth of the Lion; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death by <hi>Herod,</hi> miraculouſly delivered by an Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus underſtand it. Firſt, While God hath uſe of their ſervice upon earth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. <hi>Are there not twelve hours in the day? Luke</hi> 13.32. <hi>Go, and tell Herod that Fox, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 7.30. <hi>No man laid hands, becauſe his hour was not yet come;</hi> and 8.20. Secondly, Except by their death, they may bring more glory to God, then by their life; Old <hi>Polycarpus</hi> having ſerved Chriſt fourſcore yeers in life, if now to teeth of Lions he become a prey, it is his glory; When <hi>Paul</hi> hath finiſhed his courſe, then time to die Martyr, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Thirdly, Marvellous are the diſpenſations of providence in this kinde; ſometimes by peace propagating the Church, ſometimes by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. Under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour eſpecially this was the courſe, when weekly, daily, hundreds of Chriſtians were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred; in ſo much that the rate of one moneth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, amounted to ſeventeen thouſands; yet out of their Aſhes ſprung up New, which made <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſay, <hi>Seme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I ſay in our Saviours language, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Fear not little Flock;</hi> Though evill dayes approach us, and come on faſt; yet if God have any ſervice for us to do on earth, it is not all the ſpight of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17340:79"/> world ſhall ſhorten our dayes. Firſt, A hiding place we ſhall finde in the day of Gods wrath. Secondly, Fire ſhall not burn; The Lions ſhall not devour <hi>Daniel,</hi> while God hath ſervice for him here on earth; Some <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> God will raiſe up to ſpeak good for <hi>Ieremie</hi> to the King; ſome one or other: Boyling oyl, or lead, ſhall not deſtroy the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> Marvells, Miracles, we read in Church-Story, of ſtrange deliverances of Saints.</p>
               <p>If theſe move not; yet let us conſider. Firſt, Our hairs are numbred, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. Secondly, <hi>Are ye not of more value then Sparrows? Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it for this end, becauſe perhaps our hearts may be ſurprized with fears, in this wavering condition we live in; and our fears may perhaps diſtract, or deject us: As they ſpake, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>The God we ſerve is able to deliver us;</hi> and the Lord will certainly preſerve us in life, while he hath uſe of our ſervice upon earth: Why are we timorous, Oh we of little faith? Firſt, Meditate ſeriouſly the examples of Gods marvellous deliverances of his people in former times. Secondly, Think of the promiſe. Firſt, Either God will keep evils from us. Or, Secondly, Take us from evils, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. Or, Thirdly, Support in, or under the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, that the iſſue may be comfortable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As precious things are not parted withall, but at a dear rate; So certainly it is true, dearly they pay for the blood of Saints that ſpill
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17340:79"/> it: Truly ſaid <hi>Cyprian,</hi> There never was bloody perſecution raiſed againſt the Church; but there followed it, as an acoluthite, ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary remonſtrance of Gods vengeance; in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſword, peſtilence, captivity, and the like: From the time of righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zechary, Matt.</hi> 23. from that very day to this hath it been veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <hi>Cain</hi> had his mark, as ſome ſay terrour, and trembling ſet on him; not ſlain indeed, leſt the people ſhould forget it, but plagued in the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: their vitious manners brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly. Of <hi>Manaſseth</hi> it is noted, He filled <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with blood from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to corner; himſelf is carried away captive, and repenteth, yet to this cauſe is imputed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeers captivity in <hi>Babylon:</hi> And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our giving reaſon of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem, Matth.</hi> 23. ſaith, <hi>They had killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them who were ſent unto them:</hi> Thoſe Civill warres, read of in <hi>Romane Monarchie,</hi> began not, till perſecutions raiſed againſt Chriſtians; decay of the Empire in the heat of perſecution; till at length <hi>Mahomet</hi> firſt, and after him the <hi>Turk</hi> had ſeized the more part of the Chriſtian world: What ſhould I ſpeak of particular perſons? There is ſcarce any noted for notorious in bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perſecutions, who is read to have died a dry death; or not to have lived in horror of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or hardneſſe of heart, and blaſphemy, as we read of <hi>Herod,</hi> of <hi>Pilate,</hi> of <hi>Iulian, &amp;c.</hi> I ſpare men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe endleſſe, and unſufferable torments, reſerved for them againſt the life to come, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:17340:80"/> 1.5. Tribulation to them that trouble us, for them is reſerved the miſt of darkneſſe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And do not marvell it; For, Firſt, They coſt Chriſt dear, even his own precious blood, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 6.20. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. Secondly, They were nearly knit to Chriſt, ſo near as members one to another, as the body to the head, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. and by compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he is tortured when they are tormented. Thirdly, The malice bent toward Chriſtians, in reſpect of Chriſtianity, is bent indeed againſt Chriſt himſelf, the head of Chriſtians; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they who deſire to root Chriſtians out of the earth, would, if they could, pluck Chriſt out of heaven; In a word, The cauſe they ſuffer for, is Chriſts, no marvell if he ſo tenderly take the ſhedding of their blood, which for his ſake they ſpill; <hi>For thy ſake are we killed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt many preſages of ſome great evill coming towards us; as, Firſt, The death of ſo many Righteous. Secondly, The ripeneſſe of ſinne. Thirdly, The unprofitableneſſe of our ſmaller corrections. Fourthly, Our long Peace, and which grows up with it our deadly ſecurity. Fiftly, The melting of our hearts, as <hi>Rahab</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2. at the noiſe, or rumour, of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy, &amp;c. Give me leave to minde you of this as one, A principall meritorious cauſe of all the wrath that hangs over our heads.</p>
               <p>You may call to minde the <hi>Tempora Mariana,</hi> The dayes of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> How much precious blood of Saints was ſpilt as water upon the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17340:80"/> ground? which yet was never perhaps expiated by any wrath of God, or by any ſolemn humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people.</p>
               <p>Leſt any ſay, Theſe dayes are paſt and gone; and we have ſince had gracious Princes, who have been Nurſing-Fathers, &amp; Nurſing-Mothers to the Church, as was King JAMES, and Queen ELIZABETH, both of moſt bleſſed memory? It is true, but ſo had <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> after <hi>Manaſſeh, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> that peerleſſe King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> there was none like him before, or after; yet God remembred the ſinne of <hi>Manaſseh;</hi> and therefore ſent <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> a wicked Idolater, to carry them away captive. Oh that we could think of it, and lay to heart this amongſt all our other ſinnes! Blood defiles the land; the blood of Innocents, the blood of Martyrs is precious in Gods eyes; we muſt by our ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt know the price of it: Oh ſirs, that amongſt all our other ſinnes, this might be matter of our humiliation; peradventure yet the Lord would return, and have mercy upon us: I confeſſe, we have many ſinnes of our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall committing, but this ſinne of our fathers, how do we not tremble at? If that be it, that the ſonne ſmarts not for the father, except he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the fathers ſinne? True indeed in eternall, not ſo in temporall judgements; that made <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſe the ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his fathers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and the Lord threaten to viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>It ſerves, me thinks, for caution to all the brood of <hi>Cain</hi> amongſt us; whoſe hands indeed are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17340:81"/> but hearts boyl with malice againſt Gods people for Chriſtianity-ſake: And I am perſwaded there are amongſt us, who, if times would ſerve for it, would as willingly carry a faggot to our burning, as they now ſhoot out their arrows, even bitter words. I beſeech you pray God to give you better hearts; ye have heard that their blood is precious in Gods ſight; it will coſt you dear; honour, or ſtupidity of conſcience, and in the end everlaſting torment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Remember who ſaid, <hi>He that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye, Zech.</hi> 2.8. Thirdly, How ſtrict the charge is, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, Pſal.</hi> 105.15. Fourthly, Set before your eyes the example of Gods wrath on former perſecutours; People, Nations, Kings, Monarchies, God hath not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for this ſinne; Take we heed leſt he ſpare not us; Nay be ſure, he will not ſpare us, if we have hand, or leaſt ſtroke in their perſecution, in their blood; Not us of all people, for clearly hath the light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long amongſt us, that we cannot, as miſſed forefathers, pretend ignorance; they had been nurſed in Popiſh ſuperſtition, we in the true faith of Jeſus Chriſt; if we ſo farre fall away, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue our ſelves in the blood of Gods Saints, for us is reſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever: Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Precious, that is, highly he eſteems it, as men do things that are moſt precious, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17340:81"/> their coſtlieſt jewels; As if there were not vertue in all the whole roll of Chriſtian vertues ſo great as this, to ſuffer death for the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. <hi>They loved not their lives unto death, Heb.</hi> 12, <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto bloed in ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you it is given, not onely to beleeve, but to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt;</hi> as if therein were <hi>Munus,</hi> I ſay not <hi>in genere neceſſarii,</hi> but <hi>in genere boni,</hi> I am ſure, <hi>magni:</hi> Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles joy in it, as in their glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> when he would preferre himſelf before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſeth this ſame Argument: Ancients talk of <hi>Aureola Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum, The crown of righteouſneſſe is reſerved for all that love Chriſts appearing:</hi> but there is a Coronet upon that Crown, for them who ſuffer death for the Name-ſake of Chriſt: Tears are put into a bottle, made varniſh to our clarity, and glorious ſplendour; no drop of blood but wins us a river of glory, effuſion of it, the whole Ocean, as it were, of beatitude.</p>
               <p>It checks our cowardize; Oh we <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, daſtards, ſo timorous in declining our glor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! Why are our ſpirits ſo dejected, as to begin already to halt twixt two opinions? or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of neuterality? or joyning to the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide? Firſt, Know, there were ſometimes who were ambitious of it, <hi>Sum &amp; ego Chriſtianus.</hi> Secondly, Chriſt promiſeth to own us, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.26. Thirdly, Proteſts to deny us, if we deny him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22. Fourthly, martyrdom is neceſſary in <hi>Caſu,</hi> Abſolutely, alwayes, <hi>Quoad

Sixtly, <hi>A cloud of witneſſes,</hi> yea our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf gone before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What if the Lord ſelect us from amongſt his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Militants to be his Champions, to take up, or caſt down the Gauntlet in the quarrell to his Kingdome? Firſt, He hath promiſed to ſupport, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Secondly, Given us no Armour for the back, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. but thunders wo to the back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Thirdly, Honors with conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Prophets, to Chriſt in ſuffering, <hi>Mat</hi> 5 12. Fourthly, We are far above the ordinary rate of his Saints, when he culls us out, as it were, to reſiſt unto ſhedding of blood. Fiftly, Let us not forget it is the condition of our raigning with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Sixtly, This way went Chriſt into his Kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>The diſciple muſt not be above his Maſter.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>He hath begotten us to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>and he firſt ariſing up, hath given us a pledge of our reſurrection to immortality.</hi> Now the good Lord affect our hearts with theſe things, that we may all reſt aſſured of protection, ſo long as God hath uſe of our ſervice in life; and couragiouſly reſolve to glorifie him in our death, if he ſhall call us to ſuffer for his Name to the ſhedding of blood; knowing that our blood is precious in his ſight, and that a drop of it is not ſhed, but wins us a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of bleſſednes. But may we not think it meant of death naturall of Saints? Certainly it is true, their death is precious: underſtand, death in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17340:82"/> childe of God is not a meer paſſion; there is acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vertuous action in it, death of impious men is meerly paſſive, as of brutes; and not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and ſluggiſh reluctation; and that I ſay not onely of Nature, but of Will too. Reaſons of it are. Firſt, This life they know, the other they know not. Secondly, Have no aſſurance of better ſtate in the life to come. Thirdly, Soul in paſſage ſees terrour of Judge; and knowing no ſhare they have in the mediation of Chriſt, would live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that they might ſinne alwayes: Now in the death of Gods Saints there is action, vertuous action, the complement of all vertuous qualities; Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> calls it, <hi>The laying down of the Tabernacle;</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, His departure; Giving up the ghoſt; Commending the ſoul unto God.</hi> In which laſt act of a Chriſtian, is the perfection of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vertues. Firſt, No faith like this; <hi>Though he kill me, when he killeth me, I truſt in him, Iob</hi> 13.15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, No love like this; To love the preſent fruition of Chriſt. Thirdly, No hope like this; Even when we are dying, to expect life; when the body is falling, to expect Reſurrection. Fourthly, No obedience like this; willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the will of God in dying; and herein to ſay, <hi>Thy will be fulfilled, and I am content to do it, Pſal.</hi> 40.8. This makes even the Naturall death of Gods Saints precious in his ſight.</p>

               <p>TO diſcern Connexion in matter of Devotion is difficult, the motions thereof being for the moſt part affectionate; Howbeit, here is no difficulty: There is before mention of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours God had done him; here is the uſe of the favour.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>I am thy ſervant:</hi> And it contains a Proteſtation, or acknowledgement of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſo gracious a God, as had reſcued him from the jaws of death: wherein note we;</p>
               <p>Firſt, The occaſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The matter of the Proteſtation; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the grounds of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The vowed expreſſion of it, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>So ſee how favours of God work upon a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpotion; forcing, after a ſort, not onely to acknowledgement of obligation, but to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of ſervice unto God, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Lo! here I am, ſend me;</hi> hence Saint <hi>Auſtin, Da quod jubes, jube quod vis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reaſons why it ſhould be ſo, are; Firſt, It is all the Lord requires of us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is the Condition of continuing them; wherefore, when either we grow ſlack in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, or divert our ſelves to other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17340:83"/> Authours, God is pleaſed to remove them from us; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. Gentiles cared not to keep God in their acknowledgment, therefore Gods gives them over to their own hearts luſts; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. She knew not that it was I that gave her her corn, and wine, and oyl, &amp;c. therefore I will take away my corn in the time thereof. Thirdly, Adde hereunto that hereto is linked, the increaſe of Gods favours, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8. <hi>If that had been too little, I would have given thee more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that there were ſuch hearts in us! How would the Lord delight ſtill to do us good? mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous have his favours been, in the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deliverances of our State, yet what hath it bred, but increaſe of our rebellions? Should not the Lord be avenged on ſuch a nation as this? It is amongſt others a notable preſage of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching calamity, that we have ſo turned his grace into wantonneſſe; and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, abuſed his long ſuffering, and bountifulneſſe, to occaſion of hardneſſe of heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>See then, and examine how Gods favours work upon thee; It is ſomething not to be deſpiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the teſtimonies of a gracious diſpoſition, to be wrought to acknowledgement, and dutifull tendring of our ſelves unto God, you ſhall never or ſeldome ſee that diſpoſition in the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but the more they apprehend, or taſte the favours of God, the more indulgent they grow to their own luſts: Whether it be, Firſt, That they apprehend not Gods good in them, as they in the<note n="*" place="margin">Zeph. 1.12.</note> Prophet, <hi>He will do neither good, nor evill.</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:17340:84"/> Secondly, Or whether they think him to work after the neceſſity of his Nature, in loading them with his benefits. Thirdly, Or whether they think them merited by their own formality, and lip-outward-performances. Fourthly, Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they miſapprehend the Nature of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him an Idoll made all of mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> command to behold the<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 11.22.</note> ſeverity, as well as the bounty of God. But let ſuch mindes be farre from Gods people; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it ſuits not with grace; is not in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of it compatible with it; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord, and his goodneſse;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is mercy with him, Therefore they will fear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſhall diſcern it in your ſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; excepting the common interruptions that accompany humane infirmity. Firſt, Every new favour brings acceſſe to the meaſure of ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe to God; That which <hi>Ichu</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Baal, Ahab ſerved Baal a little, I will ſerve him much more,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. they much more truly ſay of their God; therefore ſee the greateſt Favourites have been moſt ſerviceable, <hi>Moſes</hi> more then <hi>Aaron,</hi> or <hi>Miriam, Num.</hi> 12. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> more then all the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. The woman in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel loves much, becauſe many ſinnes have been forgiven, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>The means to frame our hearts thereto are. Firſt, Obſervation, and due record of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favours to us; they are<note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 3.23.</note> renewed with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning; if we had the wiſdome to keep a

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There is a holy <hi>Reminiſcentia,</hi> calling to minde of ancient favours; ſuch eſpecially, as in times of our ignorance, and vanity, God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us; even when we knew not God, ſerved luſts, and divers pleaſures, how many his loving kindneſſes did we experiment? <hi>David</hi> thus fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it <hi>Ab ovo, Thou art my God, even from my youth, and on thee have I been caſt, even ſince my mothers womb;</hi> ſee Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Confeſſions. Thirdly, Next ſee, how little we have merited at Gods hand, as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 32.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob, I am leſse then all thy goodneſse, and trueth, which thou haſt ſhewen me.</hi> Fourthly, How contrary our merits have been, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> amplifies it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. Fiftly, How we have requited the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. ſince we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy from him.

               <p>Follows now the matter of the Proteſtation; in which obſerve we the manner of utterance in two things. Firſt, Rhetoricall Apoſtrophe.

It is no ſmall favour of God to be borne in the Church of God, no ſlender tie to his ſervice that accrues from our imitation by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme thereunto; if ye conſider, Turks, Pagans, Infidells, what can you ſay of them but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Epheſians, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>They are without God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, without hope, aliens from the covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, from the common wealth of Iſrael.</hi> They do not-derogate from Gods mercy, who ſay, That without Gods extraordinary mercy, they periſh all in their ſins, &amp; die under guilt of eternall damnation. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, No name given under heaven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can be ſaved, but onely the<note n="*" place="margin">Act 4.12.</note> Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Secondly, No means to partake him, but the knowledge and faith of him; The<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 53.11.</note> Knowledge of my righteous ſervant ſhall juſtifie many. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, No means to know him ordinary but the<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10.14</note> Word; Nor Creatures, nor any Naturall notice can reveale him. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we look back to ancient Times,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17340:85"/> where was a feed of Election, the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed extraordinarily to grant means of Vocation; ſo to <hi>Naa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an,</hi> he ſends him to the Prophet; ſo to the Eunuch, he ſends him to Hieruſalem, and <hi>Philip</hi> to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. Secondly, If we conſider other Aſſemblies of men that boaſt themſelves to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Churches of God, and are not; ſo will the Bleſſing farther appear. Falſe and erronious faith in <hi>Fundamentalibus</hi> is as perilous as flat Infidelity; for example; To beleeve; that there is a God, and to beleeve that this God is not Juſt, or True, or Mercifull, is as perillous in point of Salvation, as to be an Atheiſt, and to think there is no God: To beleeve that there is a Mediatour twixt God and Man, the Man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> and to beleeve he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates, or merits by us, is as perillous as to beleeve, There is no Mediatour twixt God and Man: To worſhip God, and the Creature as God, is as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous, as to worſhip the Creature in ſtead of God: To worſhip God otherwiſe then he will be worſhipped, or then he hath preſcribed us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in his Word, is as dangerous as to be meerly without all worſhip: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is as the ſinne of Witchcraft,</hi> and in vain they worſhip, who worſhip after doctrines of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. And if this be the Faith and Religion of ſome ſo utterly unwarrantable; ſo croſſing to the word of our Faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls, I ſay, If this be ſo, then ſay not but it is a favour of God to be born in the Church, where God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as he out, and himſelf hath preſcribed, and wherein we have the true means of ſalvation; and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17340:86"/> as they ſpake ſcoffingly to our Saviour, <hi>The way of God taught truly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This favour of God we all enjoy; yet who is there who thinks his obligation to ſerve God hereby increaſed? We dream of the Priveleges of the Church, and think it ſufficient we are born members of it, without taking notice of what they binde us unto. Firſt, Know every favour of God is an obligation to duty, and the greater the favour, the greater the obligation, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.2, 3, 4. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Where the favors are vouchſafed, and the ſervice not performed, the greater, and heavier will be the vengeance; They that ſinned without<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2.12.</note> Law, ſhall periſh without Law, they that in Law, by Law; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are not ſo ſeverely tormented as children of the Church. Thirdly, Take heed leſt hereby we occaſion the Lord to remove our<note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 2.5.</note> Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, to take from us the being of our Church; and make us by wofull experience know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence twixt ſerving God, and ſerving Idols, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Chriſt, and giving way to Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>If in the other Senſe <hi>filius ancillae</hi> be interpreted, Son of a gracious Mother, ſuch as <hi>Lois</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. &amp; 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Eunich</hi> were to <hi>Timothy,</hi> certainly the favour is great, and much increaſeth our obligation to ſerve God, to be borne, and have education from religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Firſt, Such birth brings us within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. entitles us to the promiſes of this life, and upon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, and imitation, to the promiſes of the life to come. Secondly, Advantageth us much
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17340:86"/> towards Heaven, whiles we have; Firſt, Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and nurture in the fear of the Lord. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. Secondly, The ayd of their Prayers, and Counſells, and Admonitions, as<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Eli, Oh my ſonnes, do not ſo wickedly.</hi> Thirdly, Their daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which by a kinde of naturall inſtinct we are inclined to imitate.</p>
               <p>Lord me thinks what a ſhame, and horrour is it to ſee a degenerous ſeed; and how do I perſwade my ſelf horrour of conſcience ſhall be one day augmented, torments of Hell encreaſed to them, who beſides the ordinary and common means of ſalvation in the Church, have had their birth and breeding under religious Parents?</p>
               <p>I know not how we pride our ſelves in this, that we can talke of the Devotion, and Religion hath been in our progenitours; and there are who ſtick not, though profanely, to ſay, They hope for their Parents ſake, and through their faith and piety to go to heaven, though themſelves walke in the wayes of the wicked.

               <p>Where come to be reproved Two groſſe ſinnes of theſe Times. Firſt, The Underſtanding. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Miſapplying, or miſuſage of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty iſſuing there-from.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt: That worthy Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty ſo plentifully taught by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, from the Law; how many be there that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand? It is true that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>We are not under the Law, but under grace;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Now faith is come, we are no longer under the Schole-maſter;</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man, &amp;c.</hi> with theſe grounds miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how many runne wilde into all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe? Every man when his humour takes him, taking liberty to ſinne, becauſe he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: And when we explicate, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law Ceremoniall, or Judiciall; ſee the ſhifts licentious nature hath, when they deſire to be enlarged, that Law is Jewiſh; ſo Papiſts, for Images; a Law for Jews in reſpect of proneneſſe to idolatry; So Anabaptiſts, from oathes impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to decide controverſies, a Law peculiar to Jews for their rudeneſſe, and propenſity to ſinne: So ſome profane Antiſabbatarians of the fourth; Anabaptiſts of the fifth; Gnoſticks of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; Priſcillianiſts of the ninth; that if ever there were times to ſay as <hi>David,</hi> now are the dayes; <hi>It is</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 119.126.</note> 
                  <hi>time for thee Lord to lay to thine hand,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17340:88"/> for men have deſtroyed thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us be warned to be better informed in our judgements; and remember what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He never came to deſtroy the Law, and Prophets;</hi> and what <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>We do not abrogate the Law by faith.</hi> Thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Firſt, From obligation to Laws Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and Judiciall, particular to Jews, we are freed; ſo that now no longer lies bond or any mans conſcience ſimply, as from Gods Precept, to obſerve dayes, and times, and difference of meats, and apparell. Secondly, Yet though that be ſo, we are not freed from obligation to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Morall Law; for that is the Law of nature in all the parts of it; given to <hi>Adam</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, when as yet was no difference betwixt people and people. Thirdly, But when we ſay we are free from the Law, as the Law is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, thus we deſire Scriptures ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Firſt, From the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and 5.18, 23. Secondly, From the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Law, requiring every man to bring unto Gods judgement ſeat the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law of his own perſonall perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>For without the Law is the righteouſneſse of God revealed, Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. Thirdly, From the rigour of the Law, that promiſeth no life, nor reward, but to the perfect in obedience; for our weak ſervices are accepted, yea crowned, by promiſe of God in the Goſpel. Fourthly, From exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vertue of the Law expreſſed by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.8. ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>But from obedience of the Law no man is freed. Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:17340:88"/>
               <p>The ſecond errour reproved, is the miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abuſe of the Doctrine of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even when it ſeems to be rightly underſtood; as amongſt our more intelligent people, that will confeſſe they ſtand bound to the obedience of the Decalogue; and their freedome to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Curſe, &amp;c. yet may we obſerve many abuſes of Chriſtian liberty. Firſt, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> notes one frequent in his time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. It ſeems this; That becauſe they were not under the Curſe of the Law; therefore we may ſinne: <hi>Mention,</hi> if I ſee it not rife amongſt many of our people; I would it were not amongſt ſome profeſſing beſt mindes, that becauſe there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, therefore they take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. But where learnt we thus to turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe, that becauſe Chriſt hath died to redeem us from the Curſe, therefore we ſhould ſinne againſt God? Me thinks that of <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould rather be our infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. That the love of Chriſt ſhould conſtrain us to live to his glory; withall, therein we ſhould behold the ſtrictneſſe, and ſeverity of God againſt ſinne, which nothing could expiate but the death of the Sonne of God: and can we forget what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. If we ſin wilfully, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin: and how can we be aſſured that we have ſhare in freedome from the Curſe, not being freed from the reign of ſinne? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. Yea, ſee the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of men freed from damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. They are ſuch as walk not after fleſh, but after Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:17340:89"/>
               <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> notes another; that from the other part of freedome from Morall Law, inferred a lawfull neglect of good works; for ſith we are juſtified by faith alone, what neceſſity of good works? ſee <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. But know we, though faith juſtifie alone, yet is not alone, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. though heat of fire warm alone, yet is it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light: And are there no uſes of good works, but onely to juſtifie us? What ſay you to theſe? <hi>Obedience to God, Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we bring to God in adorning the Goſpel, Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>In ſtopping the mouthes of aliens,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>In preparing them to glorifie God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and 3. and is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that by them <hi>We make calling, and election ſure?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And how ſhall we aſſure our ſelves that we are juſtified, except by our works? ſee <hi>Iames</hi> 2. And, me thinks, the glorious reward, and crown of righteouſneſſe, which God hath prepared for them that love his appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. ſhould excite us; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20.</p>
               <p>The third abuſe is that of the freedome from rigour of the Law; that becauſe God hath promiſed to accept our endeavours, though mixt with many imperfections, therefore cry out, <hi>Quor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> ſuch preciſeneſſe, and ſuch ſtriving for perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? as if the Lord had not promiſed to judge us after the mitigation of the Goſpel. True it is, there is ſuch a promiſe to ſpare us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. yet withall, there is a precept to make<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> ſtrait ſteps to our feet: To walk<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 5.15.</note> accurately; To keep our ſelves<note n="*" place="margin">Iam 1.27.</note> unſpotted of the world; To abſtain from the very<note n="*" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.22</note> appearance of evill. Secondly,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17340:89"/> He that promiſed to accept our endeavours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that they ſhould be ſtrenuous, and bent to the utmoſt of our ability, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. and ſo onely God ſpares as a father the ſonne that ſerves him. Thirdly, The imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God hath promiſed to pardon, iſſue not from preſumption, or malice, but from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and infirmity: There are three ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of actuall ſinnes in men. Firſt, Such as iſſue from ignorance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes; Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>The high Prieſt offers ſacrifice for ſinnes of ignorance.</hi> Secondly, From infirmitie or paſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>For theſe were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacrifices of atonement and propitiation.</hi> Thirdly, From preſumption, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30 And he that thus ſinnes dies without ranſome, for he hath in pride of his heart contemned the Commandment of God; and what do they leſſe, that thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of Gods mercy and bounty? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20.</p>
               <p>But mark we in the next place, the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> proteſtation, <hi>For thou haſt looſed my bonds;</hi> and ſee whether it be not applicable unto us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that freedome from Civill thraldome, and from Spirituall bondage under the Law, Morall &amp; Ceremonial, in that ſenſe that hath been explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, There is yet a threefold liberty, which we in this Church are partakers of, and they ſhould be all ſo many obligations to do ſervice unto God. Firſt, What ſay you to this? Freedome from thraldome to Idolls, and humane Traditions; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions it to <hi>Galatians</hi> as no ſmall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17340:90"/> bleſſing of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8, 9. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. If we look back to our forefathers, or caſt our eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Nations Chriſtian, what miſerable vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallage live they in under Antichriſt, &amp; the Idolls of wood and ſtone which he hath erected? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the many will-worſhips which he forceth upon the conſciences of men more then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, from theſe bonds God hath freed us. Secondly, Come yet to a more generall favour of God; Thoſe of you, I mean, whom Gods truth hath made free; What <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> was true of us, We were once the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſinne; we ſerved our luſts, and divers pleaſures, we once were holden<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> captive of the Devill, to do his will; but God, who is rich in mercy hath crucified our luſts; that now we can ſay, as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Though in our fleſh we ſerve ſinne unwillingly, yet in our ſpirit we ſerve the Law of God, deſiring to</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.5.</note> 
                  <hi>captivate every thought, and affection to the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, This is not all; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of a ſpirit of bondage, whoſe fruit is fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. and it is in every unregenerate man; The nature of it conceive thus; Firſt, The bent, and propenſion to ſinne, remains in the unregenerate, nothing but fear, or ſenſe of wrath reſtrains it; therefore that fear, or ſenſe, removed; they adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt, as <hi>Pharaoh, Simon Magus, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, There is an averſeneſſe, and abhorrence from all ſpirituall obedience; nothing but fear of wrath, or hope of reward excites, or continues it; therefore ſee <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, Mal.</hi> 3.14. when they ſee the proud bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17340:90"/> ſay it is vain to ſerve God: From this ſpirit of bondage to fear, hath God freed his children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. Stabliſh me with thy free Spirit; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Set my heart at liberty, I will runne the way of thy Commandments; And again, Oh that my wayes were made ſo direct; Where Gods Spirit is, there is liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. Lord, that theſe might be ſo many motives to vow our ſelves ſervants for ever of the living God.</p>
               <p>We are not ignorant of Satans wiles; and we know what our ſelves and ſinnes have deſerved; the plague that God threats to<note n="*" place="margin">Deut 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be given up to ſerve Idolls of wood, and ſtone; that we may by experience know difference twixt the ſervice of God, and the ſervice of Idolls: but ſure if that betide us, miſerable is our condition; better we had never known the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then knowing to turn back.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Like let us think whoſe hearts God hath enlarged, and ſet free from the ſlaviſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to our ſinnes; whoſe eyes God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to ſee the filthineſſe of drunkenneſſe, of adultery, &amp;c. And to whom he hath given grace heretofore to deteſt them; if we ſhall now again be intangled, our latter end ſhall be worſe then our beginning, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And for thoſe amongſt us to whom God hath given that ſpirit of ingenuity, with freedome of heart to ſerve God; let them take heed, how they quench the Spirit, the holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby God would bend them to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17340:91"/> and chearfulneſſe in his ſervice. Conſider, Firſt, How bitter ſuch dulneſſe of ſpirit is to the conſcience, when God awakes it; no leſſe to a gracious minde, then groſſer ſinnes have been in their firſt entrance to Chriſtianity. Secondly, Next, how they looſe for the time, the beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being accepted with God, there being no ſervice that pleaſeth him, but what is offered with a willing minde; ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. Thirdly, What an aggravation to every omiſſion it will one day be, that when God gave us alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberty, and freedome of ſpirit to ſerve him, yet we were backward.</p>
               <p>Follows now in the ſeventeenth Verſe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Davids</hi> ſerviceableneſſe unto God, in two particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, Thankſgiving.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Invocation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the firſt we have two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, The Office.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, The Stile it hath; Sacrifice.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Of the firſt: Thankfulneſſe implies four things. Firſt, Acknowledgement of the favour of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour, and our obligation in reſpect of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.4. Secondly, Mindfulneſſe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the favour done to us; hence it is a tax upon the chief Butler, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.23. that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> but forgate him. Thirdly, Publiſhing with praiſe and commendation, the bounty, and love, and goodneſſe of the Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17340:91"/> as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Oneſiphorus</hi> his kindneſſe. Fourthly, Compenſation, or recompenſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ability, and opportunity given us of God; ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.1, 3. <hi>Is there yet any of the houſe of Saul, to whom I may ſhew kindneſſe for Ionathans ſake;</hi> ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.32, 33, 38. And they have in a ſenſe all their place in that thankfulnes we are to perform to our God.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt, ſee <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. when he ſaw the Lord preſerving the remnant of his people, <hi>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not confounded; Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am leſse then the leaſt of all thy mercies, and all thy truth which thou haſt ſhewen;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10 <hi>Not meet to be an Apoſtle; but by grace I am what I am;</hi> ſee alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. which All of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and debt of ſervice we owe to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his favours; <hi>Quid retribuam Domino?</hi> As if he had ſaid, A debt I ſee, wherein I ſtand bound to my God, but how I ſhall render it I know not; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>What thanks can we render unto God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oppoſite unto this Branch of Thankfulnes are. Firſt, Slighting of the favours of God beſtowed on us, without any ſo much as notice, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement in their fruition; How many favours are renewed with every morning, which yet we take no notice of? As that the Lord adds this day to our time of repentance, or growth in grace; that his temporalls of health, and uſe of all his good creatures are continued unto us. Or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We diſcern no favour of God in them, nor think our ſelves obliged to that endleſſe Majeſtie
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17340:92"/> for the continuance, or increaſe of them; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think them to come of ordinary courſe; or as it ſhould ſeem for ſome obligation that lies upon God, either in his own Nature, or from our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to conferre them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is remembrance of the benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us; as <hi>David</hi> to his ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. <hi>Forget not all his benefits:</hi> To this end tended the annuall feſtivities of the Jews that we read of, <hi>Num.</hi> 29. to continue remembrance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God; To this end the Sabbath in old Teſtament; To this the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and our Sacrament of the Supper ſucceeding in ſtead thereof; Hence is the charge <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Take heed, leſt thou forget not the Lord thy God;</hi> and that tax of ingratitude laid upon <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 106.13. <hi>They ſoon forgate his works:</hi> And I would to God it concerned not us, nor were imputable unto us; Whiles favours are new, we can a little overly, and for faſhion ſay, God be thanked; but once year'd and day'd, they ſcarce ever come more into our thought: Oh that <hi>Davids</hi> minde were in us! How ſhould the Lord ſtill delight to do us good? See him fetching it <hi>Ab utero,</hi> for his own particular, from the wombe; and for the people of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105, 106, 107. all penned to minde the people of God of his ancient benefits, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of Aegypt, &amp;c. We alſo have had our deliverances from the great thraldome under the tyranny of <hi>Rome;</hi> there be yet living who may remember it, but ſcarce take notice of it in nature of a benefit; What ſhould I tell of the reſtoring
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17340:92"/> of the purity of the Goſpel in the dayes of Queen ELIZABETH? The admirable victories of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight? The deliverance from Gunpowder-Treaſon? Our long peace in the reign of King JAMES? Our preſervation from the peſtilence? &amp;c. They are year'd and day'd, and therefore forgotten amongſt us. Take heed, leſt ſome worſe thing happen not unto us.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of King EDWARD, God cauſed the light of his glorious Goſpel to ſhine unto our fathers, as under <hi>Ioſiah</hi> to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it ſeems they knew not the price of that bleſſing; therefore the Lord took him away from the evill to come, and delivers us over to be a prey to our enemies; What bloody cruelty, what fierie triall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iſſued, we are not, I think, ſo Lethargicall, as to forget; if ever the ſame prove our lot, thank our ſelves, for that we have ſo ſoon forgotten the great favours beſtowed upon our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third Branch of Thankfulneſſe, is publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the favour of God, with praiſe of the bounty therein ſhewed towards us; This is that <hi>David</hi> calls praiſing the Lord; that is, not onely commemorating, but ſetting out the excellencie of his favours beſtowed upon us; And this indeed is a ſpeciall part of Thankfulneſſe: Therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how Rhetoricall the Saints of God are in all circumſtances of Amplification; Sometimes admiring the riches of Gods favour, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Oh how great is thy goodneſſe!</hi> ſee alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confeſſing they paſſe knowledge, ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:17340:93"/> 3.19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Sometimes in a heap of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithetes ſetting forth their excellencie; as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rich in mercie; great love;</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The grace of God was exceeding abundant;</hi> Sometimes, comparing themſelves with others of equall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20. Sometimes conſidering their own demerits, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. their little thought of the favour, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite unto this Branch of Thankfulneſſe are. Firſt, Extenuating, or leſſening the favours God hath beſtowed upon us, and vilifying them, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael, They</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 106.24.</note> 
                  <hi>deſpiſed the pleaſant land;</hi> and as the inſtance is plain in the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> what at firſt they admired, <hi>Exo.</hi> 16. at laſt cryed out of, as of a bread that dryed up their ſouls. Secondly, Accounting his bleſſings curſes, and his favours rather Tokens of his wrath, and diſpleaſure, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their hunger and thirſt; Would God we had tarried in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when we ſate by the fleſh-pots, and had meat to the full; and was it becauſe there was no graves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the Lord hath brought us out into this barren wilderneſſe? And I wiſh we were not culpable of both theſe ſignes of unthankfulneſſe! Lord, Who knows the power of thy wrath? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.11. The price of thy bleſſing, that ſweet bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace, which <hi>David</hi> prayed for to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Let peace be within thy walls, and plenteouſneſſe within thy palaces;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.21. The Lord ſhall give unto his people the bleſſing of peace; <hi>To ſit every one under our own vine, and every one under our own fig-tree.</hi> Alas! How hath it been vilified?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17340:93"/> Nay, How hath it been thought a curſe to the land, by earthly-minded men; and warre, one of the<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 14.21.</note> ſoreſt arrows of the Almighty, wiſhed for rather then peace? Sure I cannot deny but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs many have iſſued from peace; as that of <hi>Moab, Ier.</hi> 48. <hi>Our ſavour remains in us;</hi> as ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waters gather filth, and putrefaction, ſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, peace. Secondly, Security, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, as <hi>Laiſh</hi> dwelt<note n="*" place="margin">Iudg. 18.11.</note> ſecurely. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Luxurie, and intemperance, the ſinne of<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 16.49.</note> 
                  <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> through abundance of idleneſſe. But comes this from peace, or from our abuſe of peace? Is it the native fruit of this gracious bleſſing of God, or not rather grown upon us by accident through corruption of our filthy hearts? So of the word of God, and worſhip, the prime of Gods outward favours; inſomuch, that it bears the ſtile often of the<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 13.11.</note> kingdome of heaven; yet who eſteems it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worth of it? Nay, be there not that think it not even the ſcourge of the times; never merry world ſince this preaching came up: and generally, how wanton are we grown, the beſt of us, that every man muſt have it ſuited in matter, and manner to his own fancy; ſome are for plainneſſe; ſome for nicety, and novelty; and nothing pleaſeth but what is above the ordinary, &amp;c. Well, brethren, time was when the word of God was<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.1.</note> precious; that was, when it was rare. Secondly, Times may be, (God grant they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not) when we may again ſee <hi>Amos</hi> his<note n="*" place="margin">Amos 8.11.</note> famine.</p>
               <p>Time being to ſpeak of other diſcontents at
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17340:94"/> Gods favour, and not onely vilifying of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, but murmuring at the hand which conferres them: The Remedies of it are theſe. Firſt, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the miſery of the want of theſe bleſſings, which we enjoy to the full, till we nauſeat again, and our ſtomack recoils at them. Secondly, Weigh well how farre inferiour our merits are to the leaſt of theſe favours of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. Thirdly, See how many are behinde us, if not in the ſubſtance, yet in the meaſures of the bleſſings: Lord Sirs; we look to thoſe above us that excite our envie; would we caſt our eyes downwards to thoſe below us, we ſhould ſee, and ſay, the Lord had exceeded mercy towards us; and that his love to us, hath paſſed knowledge, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
               <p>The fourth Branch of Thankfulneſſe; is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, or Recompenſe: Hath this place, or paſſage twixt God and man? Sure we have Gods complaint frequent, for Non-retaliation, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi> and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.33. <hi>Hezekiah rendred not to the Lord according to the kindneſſe done unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of Retaliation. Firſt, One equall, or equivalent to the favours of God; This no Papiſt dares avow poſſible to be yeelded from man to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Our well doing extend th not to God;</hi> and, <hi>What is it to him that we are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Iob</hi> 35. and, <hi>I am leſse then the leaſt of all thy mercies, Gen.</hi> 32.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Proportioned, which in a ſort they ſay is anſwerable to the favours God hath done
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17340:94"/> us; and not <hi>Ex pacto</hi> onely, or by vertue of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but ſomething out of the native vertue, and excellencie of the works done, God is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for his favours; yet it was wont to be ſaid, <hi>Finiti ad infinitum nulla eſt proportio;</hi> all that we do, or can do, is but<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 17.10.</note> duty; yea, as we do it, not ſo much as duty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. And moreover, of his own we give him; It is he himſelf that works all our good works in us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yet there is which God is pleaſed to interpret, and accept as rendrings from us; even whatſoever according to our gracious abilities by way of thankfulneſſe, we tender unto him; ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Acceptable to God through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> As, Firſt, The ordering of our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. When we ſo live, as God in us may be glorified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, When in our Callings particular, we ſeek the advancement of Gods glory, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. Thirdly, Speciall occaſions oft fall out, when it becomes our lot to ſtand up for the ſupport of Gods glory, perhaps with hazard of ſtate, or life; as in <hi>Heſters</hi> caſe, <hi>Hoſt.</hi> 4.16. <hi>If I periſh; I periſh:</hi> Theſe God interprets, and accepts as thankfull rendrings, and retaliations to his bounty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in how anſwerable we have been to the favours God hath beſtowed upon us, and their meaſures; if I ſhould hold my peace, the ſtones would ſpeak; What Nation under the Sunne hath been able to compare with us in all favours, that God hath done us? as the Lord ſpeaks to<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the meaſures, and continuance of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17340:95"/> bleſſings, we have been as peerles in ingraditude; turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our rebellions, as God hath his bleſſings upon us: I could wiſh we could ſee the preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts we have had above many our neighbours, in the meaſure of the means of ſalvation, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of them; the iſſues whereof, except in point of knowledge, and that but in a few, hath been no great increaſe of our obedience; but that in juſtice, and charity, and mercy, many ignorants have gone before us. Do we thus requite the Lord? This let us reſt aſſured of generally for our kingdome; The Lord who hath made his mercies marvellous towards us, will make his plagues as wonderfull, that we may be a by-word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. And at the laſt day; it will be true of us, that Chriſt ſpeaks of unthankfull ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. The ſtate of heathen ſhall be more tollerable then ours.</p>
               <p>The Stile here given to Thankſgiving; It is a Sacrifice; Metaphorically ye muſt underſtand, and by Alluſion; ſo called, becauſe all thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices offered in the old Leviticall Law did type out this ſame thankſgiving, (all Ceremonies of the old Teſtament, as <hi>Gratian</hi> tells us, having in them to be conſidered both ſuperficies, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis intelligentia</hi>) as the thing which ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in room, or ſtead thereof; in which reſpect our<note n="*" place="margin">Rom 12.1.</note> bodies; our<note n="*" place="margin">Phil 4.18.</note> goods; our thanks are called Sacrifices; The fruit of our lips, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. Or elſe ſecondly, Becauſe in eſteem with God more then al ſacrifices of bullocks, or rams,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17340:95"/> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.8, 9. which alſo perhaps makes <hi>David</hi> chuſe it as the ſpeciall evidence expreſſing his ſerviceableneſſe to God. Lo here then the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of thankfulneſſe, farre above all ſacrifices, or other ſervices we perform unto God; ſee <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.23. He honoureth me, comparatively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, more then he who brings the fat of rams, or ten thouſand rivers of oyl, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Lord, that we could ſet our ſelves to it; ſure it is the ſervice of heaven, wherein Angels, and<note n="*" place="margin">See Iſa. 6. Apoc. 6.</note> Saints are imployed; and they who rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready their converſation in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time eſpecially it is neceſſary, when we come to receive the pledges of Gods love, and goodneſſe in our Redemption; whereupon the whole action hath the name of Euchariſt; and in which reſpect, the Fathers called it a ſacrifice, and the Table from which they offered it, in a ſpirituall ſenſe, an Altar; wherefore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper was by them alſo ſtiled <hi>Sacramentum Altaris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are helps available thereto. Firſt, See our portion, or ſharing in the bleſſing; that we may be able to ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> every of us; <hi>Chriſt loved</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> it is lip-labour that without this is performed in reſpect of Redemption: Thus diſcern it. Firſt, Redeemed from vain converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. Secondly, Setting our ſelves apart to ſerve God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and true holineſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. Thirdly, <hi>Zealous of good works, Tit.</hi> 2.14. wherein we may
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17340:96"/> bring glory to God. Fourthly, Permitting our Redeemer to diſpoſe of us to his glory, whether by life or death; out of this ground, <hi>That we are not our own,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p>Second particular wherein <hi>David</hi> meant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his ſervice to God, is Invocation; Calling upon him onely in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>That this is an honour, and ſervice due to God, Scriptures are evident; inſomuch, that Tropical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is put for the whole ſervice of God, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And conſider what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it gives him, you will eaſily acknowledge it. Firſt, Thereby we acknowledge him to be Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all good things, ſee <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. and that but from him we can expect nothing that is good. Secondly, Of power, in that therein we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him able to do above all that we can ask, or think, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. Thirdly, Of love to man no leſſe then fatherly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. wherein the Lord ſo glories, that he hath given it a ſpeciall Name, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. Fourthly, Of mercie, and compaſſion, wherein the Lord ſo glories, as in no one of his Attributes; ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and God of all conſolation.</hi> Fiftly, Of Dominion, and Lordſhip abſolute, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; for whileſt we pray God for all we have need of, what do we but acknowledge him to have in himſelf abſolute power to give, or not to give farther then by his promiſe he hath pleaſed to make himſelf our debtour? Sixtly, Of his truth, ſuppoſing his <hi>Pactum,</hi> his Covenant, and promiſe that he hath paſſed to us; wherefore alſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17340:96"/> ye ſee it often acknowledged as inducement to grant; ſee <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. All this ſhews abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that it is a ſervice due to God. To all theſe might be added alſo, that hereby God is himſelf acknowledged as the alone <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Knower of the heart. Now whether in propriety, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably, is now grown matter of queſtion; Conceive thus; whether no creature, Saint, nor Angel, may participate with him in it, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? Thus farre goes conſent; That nor Saint, nor Angel may be prayed unto as Authours, or Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, either of<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 84.11.</note> grace, or glory; becauſe the things we need, exceed the power of all creatures to give; To which alſo the Papiſts themſelves adde conſent of the whole Church, that nor Saint, nor Angel is to be invocated as Authour of the bleſſings.</p>
               <p>How then are they intereſſed in this honour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As mediatours of impetration, or obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the good things we have need of; and yet not as principall Interceſſors, but as ſuch, as by Chriſt and his interceſſion commend our ſuits unto God: Wherein you muſt underſtand they palliate onely that horrible Idolatry they practiſe in Invocation of Saints; for whoſo looketh to the forme of their prayers, ſhall finde that they pray to them as Lords of the gifts. Secondly, That they ſend them not to God by Chriſt as Mediatour of Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as men who by their own merits may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſuits unto God, and even oblige him to grant what we pray for.</p>
               <p>The queſtion at laſt comes to this iſſue; upon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17340:97"/> ſuppoſall that they pray to them onely as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of impetration; Whether we may invocate Saints departed as mediatours of impetration, or entreat them to entreat for us favours from God? They ſay, Yes, becauſe we may ſo do to men on earth, and that without any derogation to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it follows not; for a twofold Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Firſt, Becauſe for the one we have a Mandate, to begge the aid of living<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note> Saints prayers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, We have example of Saints, as of <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. Thirdly, We have promiſe from God that the prayer of faith ſhall finde audience, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. neither of which we finde of Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Secondly, For that we have means to make known our wants to Saints on earth, none at all to informe, at leaſt our mentall deſires, to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 63.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham knows us not:</hi> And for means of convaying them to their notice, there is none which hath foundation in Scripture, what ever they pretend for revelation of Angels converſing with us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny not but at times they converſe with us on earth; but that they have their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall commerce about us, we finde no Scripture to affirme; onely that they are<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> ſent out upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for good. Secondly, Suppoſe our prayers mentall onely, as oft they are, and oft ſo moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Why cryeſt thou? Underſtand they them? Without robbing God of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable glory to be the onely Knower of hearts, they cannot affirm it; it ſhall ever be

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That through the incredible ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity of their nature, they do by themſelves hear prayers made to them on earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers. Firſt, That this cannot be true of Mentall prayers, though ſuch celerity ſuppoſed. Secondly, That to this end they may hear all prayers made to them, is requiſite not onely celerity of nature, but alſo ubiquity, when at the ſame inſtant ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers are made to the ſame Saint; and no <hi>Motus</hi> is <hi>in inſtanti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their third is, That they ſee in God all things; Hence their <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their beatitude?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And yet Chriſt knew not the day of Judgement, though from the firſt inſtant of his Incarnation, he enjoyed beatificall viſion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Where finde we ſuch a <hi>Speculum Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> mentioned in Scripture? Thirdly, Suppoſe ſuch a <hi>Speculum;</hi> It is not <hi>Naturale,</hi> but <hi>Voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſo that nothing can be thence informed, but what God will have them know.</p>
               <p>Their fourth is Revelation; That God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal unto them our prayers, when we powre them out before him; And ſo Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But where finde they that God reveals to them the prayers that are made unto them? Secondly, And ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> then would the Saints pray to God ſometimes to reveal to Saints
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17340:98"/> their prayers. Thirdly, And that was as likely to be vouchſafed to Patriarks, and Prophets in ancient time; when yet it is ſaid, <hi>Abraham knows us not, Iſa.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>To draw to concluſion in this Point; I would but know for my learning of any Papiſt in the world, why I ſhould chuſe to go to God by a Saint, rather then by Jeſus Chriſt our known Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate? Is it becauſe their prayers are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with God? It were blaſphemy to think it: Are they more mercifull? How derogate they from that glory of the high<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. &amp; 4.</note> Prieſt of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? Or is it more humility?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is pride, not humility that ſhews it ſelf in ſuch will-worſhip, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. And what, is the condition of Saints in new Teſtament inferiour to that of them in the old? If they without any ſuch ambages might approach unto God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, why not we rather, when Chriſt appears for us at the right hand of our Father? <hi>Roman.</hi> 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>And if there were nothing elſe might breed in us deteſtation of Popery, this yet alone ſhould; ſeeing it ſo robs God of his honour, of mercie, gratuitous love to man, omniſcience, &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it in equality, or greater meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to creatures; Chriſt of his meritorious interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of his propriety in mediating twixt God and us? ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>

Thirdly, For this we have warrant by<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note> mandate, and promiſe, which we lack for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints. Fiftly, Encouragements we have plentifull, <hi>He gives to all liberally, and</hi>

But that Saints do hear them, we know not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As in the miſapplying of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from God to Saints, is idolatry; ſo in the neglect of it is crime no leſſe then Atheiſme, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. and detainment of ſervice which we owe to our God; wherein I wiſh our people were not all obnoxious, and culpable.</p>

               <p>Leſt the Application of the Pſalme to Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gentiles, ſeem impertinent; Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.11. where ye ſhall obſerve the Apoſtle ſo applying it.</p>
               <p>For farther underſtanding, Know that from the dayes of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> began God to limit his people to one Family and Nation; before that time, all being <hi>Quoad jus,</hi> The people of God: in their dayes, was God pleaſed, for the ſinnes of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17340:101"/> other nations, and ſpecially for love to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to election, to ſingle out the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> to be his peculiar people; and to diſtinguiſh them by ſignes from others; by ſignes, I ſay, of ſpeciall Covenant; as Circumciſion in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family: afterwards, the giving of the<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9.4.</note> Law, and the <hi>ſervices;</hi> which was the Maceria ſpoken of, the<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 2.14.</note> Partition wall mentioned by the Apoſtle; inſomuch that though all other people and kingdomes of the world retained the Stile, and Title of Nations, and people at large; Yet none of the people of God, ſave <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> and their poſterity; And this encloſure of grace to them, though ye reckon but from the giving of the Law to Chriſt, when the diſtinction grew compleat unto Chriſt, endured the ſpace of above ſixteen hundred yeers; what time the Jews growing to height of Impiety, were rejected of God, and in their ſtead we Gentiles graffed in, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. ſo that in <hi>Pauls</hi> time they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corpores; and from that time to now have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the onely body of Chriſt, the fulneſſe of him which filleth all in all, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>So long ago was God pleaſed to foretell the Calling of the Gentiles; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and 50. and 97. What ſpeak we of ſo late as <hi>David?</hi> even in the very Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> it was ſignified, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.5. and 18.18. and in the ſigne <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>If the queſtion now be, Why the Lord was pleaſed ſo long ago to foretell it; Thus let him conceive. Firſt, <hi>Predictio futurorum,</hi> the foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17340:101"/> of things to come, I mean of Contingent things that have no cauſe in Nature, are no ſmall evidence of a Deity; whereupon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. Idols are put to that iſſue. Secondly, The accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Predictions are excellent nouriſhers of Hope concerning things to come, which we behold onely in the Promiſe; as <hi>Iehu</hi> makes the obſervation,<note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 10.10.</note> No word of God ſhall fall to the ground; many gracious Promiſes are given us, which yet are not performed, &amp;c. Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God meant from the beginning of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to nouriſh his people Iſrael in the fear of his Name, not willing to give them leaſt occaſion of being puffed up with Pride in reſpect of his ſpeciall favour; Wherefore alſo they are often afterwards by the Ancients of the Prophets put in minde of it, ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>That a man would wonder, ſave that blindneſſe is come upon Iſrael in part, to read how Jews of old, and to this day are averſe from the doctrine, which teacheth entertainment of Gentiles into the Church of God: If ye read the ſtory of the Goſpel, there was nothing went more harſh in Chriſts doctrine, then this of taking away the kingdome from the Jews: and when <hi>Paul</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 13 and 28. preached this doctrine, he alwayes became unſufferable: But thus deſerve they to be blinded in plaineſt things, that refuſe obedience to the will of God.</p>
               <p>Other Errors there are noted of like nature. Firſt, Of Donatiſts in Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> dayes, whoſe doctrine was, That God had no Church but in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17340:102"/> 
                  <hi>Afrique,</hi> and that in the party of <hi>Donatus.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Exactly ye ſhall obſerve the ſame errour revived by Papiſts and Browniſts: Papiſts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for an encloſure of the Church to their <hi>Rome,</hi> thereto alledge that which ſpecially thwarts it, the Title of <hi>Catholique;</hi> for if Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, then not Romane no more then Jewiſh; that tearm being deviſed by Ancients, eſpecially, to diſtinguiſh the Church Chriſtian from that of the Jews: And if to all Nations, then not to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> onely, or to the part of <hi>Donatus,</hi> for all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt praiſe God for his mercy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no neceſſity for any man to ſubmit himſelf to <hi>Donatus,</hi> or <hi>Browne,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; though it be true, out of the Church is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet out of this or that Church is ſalvation, except Chriſt be not the Saviour of his whole Bodie.</p>
               <p>But thoſe things which the Lord ſo long ago foretold to our fathers by the Prophets he hath fulfilled to us their children; making us who once were Aliens and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.12, 13.</note> nigh to himſelf by the blood of Chriſt; To this end tended that gift of Tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. The memory whereof we this day Celebrate; For in that ſo many Nations heard the Apoſtles ſpeak in their own tongues the manifold works of God, it ſerves to ſhew, that God meant now to verifie his Promiſe to us: I ſay onely as<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 15.11.</note>

                  <q>For his mercifull kindneſse is great towards me.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN theſe words we have the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> thankſgiving, and prayſing God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Gods Mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Meaſure of it, Great.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe is not to inſiſt, on this occaſion, in the common place of Gods mercy; Thus onely for ſo much as concernes the Senſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The mercy of God ſome call the property, or attribute of his Nature, inclining him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the miſery of his Creature; ſome, the Eſſence of God ſhewing mercy; Trueth is, there is no Reall difference twixt his Eſſence and his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ſave onely in our manner of conceiving; The Trueth of God, and his Eſſence are not two things, but in our apprehenſion, no more is his Power, Omniſcience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Mercy of God is of three ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Generall towards all Creatures wrapped in miſery, whereof ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Speciall towards men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. preſerving them from many dangers, yea, reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their miſeries with ſervice of his other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Singular to his Church; not onely in giving them means of ſalvation, and deliverance from Curſe, but to many of them vouchſafing the ſenſe of his choiſeſt favours, in remiſſion of ſins,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17340:103"/> gifts of the Spirit, and life everlaſting; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſpeaks the Prophet in this place: for theſe are the benefits which Chriſt brings to his Church.</p>
               <p>As if there were no mercy of God like unto this, The mercy that he ſhews unto us in Chriſt: and ſurely conſider all other miſeries, we ſhall ſee none like this, <hi>To be without Chriſt,</hi> for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature. Secondly, The amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it hath in Scripture. Thirdly, The kinds of mercy in him vouchſafed us. For the firſt, Goe over all the miſeries of the brute Creatures, and compare them with the miſery of man without Chriſt, ye ſhall ſee, they all come ſhort of it: <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 34.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Lions lack, and ſuffer hunger;</hi> It is true, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them pined with hunger, yet with their life ends their miſery; When a man <hi>out of Chriſt</hi> hath endured Hunger, and Cold, and Nakedneſſe, and Fire and Water, or what ever man can deviſe to be moſt terrible to Fleſh, yet is it but a Flea-bite to the miſery whereto a man out of Chriſt is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <hi>their</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 9.44.</note> 
                  <hi>Worme dies not, their fire goes not out;</hi> which made our Saviour ſay, It was better with loſſe of Lim, or Life to go to heaven, then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the pleaſures of this life, at death to be caſt into hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look again to the amplifications it hath in Scripture; He denied all theſe to<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; they fell, and no Redeemer: He denied theſe to many men, even to ſo many as had<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 147 20.</note> 
                  <hi>not knowledge of his Laws.</hi> Thirdly, In his very Church though offer be made to all, yet actuall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and taſte onely to the Church of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17340:103"/> the firſt borne whoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thinke of the excellency of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Firſt, Remiſſion of ſinnes ſee <hi>David</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, Beſides, the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and gracious endowments, whereby we are renewed after his Image: and that which paſſeth knowledge, the fulneſſe of Joy reſerved for us at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>This taxeth that earthly, or rather brutiſh eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that men ſet on this prime mercy of God, preferring before it the worſt of thoſe favors they partake in common with Heathens, with Devills, with brute Creatures, with Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>How many be there even of a brutiſh diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of God, who never have thought of Heaven, or Hell; God, or the Devill; Let them have meat, and drinke, and eaſe to the fill, as<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak, it is their <hi>Summum bonum;</hi> and yet the very heathen could ſay, It was the thought of a Beaſt, rather then of a Man: And have ye not heard of him who had all theſe things, and yet<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 16.</note> afterwards was in Hell in torments: or can you forget our Saviour? when all is had that the world can afford you in profit, or pleaſure, yet what ſhall your advantage be, when you muſt looſe your<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 16.24.</note> Soul? and have ye not heard of them, who cry out What hath pride<note n="*" place="margin">Wiſd. 5.8.</note> profited them, or what the pompe of Riches availed?</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17340:104"/>
               <p>Go farther to other gifts of God in providence; Suppoſe it be Art, Whoſe is like that of <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> Suppoſe it kingdomes, Whoſe like to that of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or <hi>Grecia,</hi> or <hi>Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Rome?</hi> Suppoſe it wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as that of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the Oracle of Iſrael? Yet what is all this, without the<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> knowledge of Chriſt, ſave onely to deprive of excuſe? ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>Go yet farther to the power of Knowledge, and Faith, and of deep Myſteries in the Goſpel; the very<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> Devils herein equall, excell us; and though we had all Knowledge, and Faith, What were it without Chriſt? as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the point of Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</p>
               <p>Yet farther, for I thinke Hypocrites go farther then Devills; ſuppoſe thou haſt morall Honeſty, as<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 5.20.</note> Phariſees had; yet muſt there be a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe greater to bring thee to God: Suppoſe thou hadſt<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 7.22.23</note> Prophecy, yet mayeſt thou be diſmiſſed with <hi>ne ſcio vos, I never knew you:</hi> Suppoſe all thoſe excellent endowments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods mercy to thee in Chriſt, What doth all this adde to thee, except an aggravation to thy damnation?</p>
               <p>Lord, methinks therefore that I might enamore you of love towards this mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and prevaile with you aright to eſteeme it: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he comes to ſpeak of it never<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies himſelf in it; deſires to know nothing but Chriſt, and him Crucified; accounts all but Dung, and<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 3.8.</note> Droſſe in compariſon; and again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>it paſſeth knowledge.</hi> This being enamord on it is, if
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17340:104"/> not an evidence of our ſharing in it, yet a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
               <p>Before ever we ſhall come to know the price of it, Three things muſt be removed out of our hearts, which are naturall to moſt men, to all men, one or other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ignorance of our miſery in Nature without Chriſt; my meaning is That we either know not, or conſider not what puniſhment our ſins have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, or how ſtrict the juſtice of God is againſt them: For remedy whereof I would preſcribe; Firſt, Diligent examination of our lives by the Law of God; Lord, how many fowle ſins ſhould the greateſt Civilian in the world then perceive in himſelf? Secondly, The puniſhments threatned therein, Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 28. Gal. 3.10.</note> curſe in body, in ſoul, in this life, in the life to come. Thirdly, The exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the curſe, and the execution upon the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it; extraordinary upon other men tainted with our vices; inſomuch that there is no groſſe violation of any Law of God, but we have ſeen exemplified on others, might ſee them in our ſelves. Fourthly, The ſtrictneſſe of Gods juſtice, which without ſatisfaction, which indeed is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction every way equivalent to the violation of Juſtice, accepts none to mercy: And this methinks ſhould teach us how to eſteem of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe is, Opinion of our owne poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to make ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the whole world of Pagans furniſh them with Preſidents; thence grew ſacrificings of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Sonnes and Daughters; thence all thoſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17340:105"/> whippings, &amp;c. in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thereby to ſatisfie the juſtice, and wrath of God due to Sins; the ſame point. For Remedy let us ſee whether according to Reaſon, or Scripture we can poſſible make amends for ſinnes of our ſouls. Firſt, The Majeſty violated is Infinite. Secondly, What give we more then<note n="*" place="margin">1 Chro. 29.14</note> God hath given us? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What <hi>indebitum?</hi> as Papiſts themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it muſt be, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. Fourthly, What <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum?</hi> which is the point; ſo that if God ſhould enter into Judgement with us, we had not need to pray for mercy in acceptance, rather then dream of making him ſatisfaction. Fifthly, Who can tell how<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 19.12.</note> oft he offendeth? our Good-works for the matter of them are eaſily numbred, our ſinnes are paſt number; that this we muſt let alone, for ever thought of ſatisfying Gods juſtice, without a Mediatour.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe, That we never yet were ſenſibly arraigned in our Conſciences for our ſinnes, nor for miſery in Nature, nor diſability to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for ſinnes of our ſouls by own ſtrength na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, or gracious: thence is it, that we know not aright to price the mercy of God to us in Jeſus Chriſt. Beloved Chriſtians, To ſin is common; to feel burthen of ſinne is, if not a ſpeciall, yet a rare benefit: that though I ſay not Reprobates may feel it, and ſo heavy that it preſſeth them to Hell, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet ſurely it is rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of God; ſo that I begin to be of opinion, that thoſe graces common to us with ſome Caſtawayes grow marvellous rare amongſt the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17340:105"/> people of God: Judge of it by theſe evidences. Firſt, The ventrouſneſſe of ſome men into groſſeſt ſinnes for profit, pleaſure, or honours ſake. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The little, or no griefe they worke when they are committed. Thirdly, The leſſe care of making peace with God by Jeſus Chriſt, the<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> trampling of his Grace, and mercy under our feet. Fourthly, That common abuſe of it in the vulgar, as if they thought his death had purchaſed an indulgence, rather then a pardon for ſin: But oh that we could learn to prize it aright; How might we hope it ſhould ſtil continue amongſt us! but as the baſe eſteem of it amongſt Jews remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to Gentiles; ſo <hi>è contrà,</hi> may the baſe eſteem thereof amongſt the Gentiles remoove it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Jews; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you a right underſtanding in all things.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17340:106"/> and of the words wherein thoſe things are enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3, 4. ſo God is true, truely conceiving, and enunciating things as they are. Thirdly, Ethicall Truth, the congruence of all our words with the things, and our conceptions, and of our facts with our intentions, and pretenſes: So here principally underſtand <hi>David</hi> ſignifies; Firſt, That the Lord truely, and according to the very trueth of things avoucheth whatſoever he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth, and that without all doubling. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Promiſſory, which commonly we call the faithfulneſſe of God; and it ſtands in two things. Firſt, The Concord of his Intention with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Secondly, The anſwerableneſſe of the fact to the promiſe infallible; and hereof ſpeaks the Prophet.</p>
               <p>And it is ſaid, <hi>To laſt for ever;</hi> becauſe to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without alteration he is faithfull, and true, and unalterably in all times makes good whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath promiſed.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, that after this life, when all promiſes are performed, there is no uſe of ſuch Fidelity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Diſtinguiſh the vertue from the exerciſe. Secondly, To all eternity there is uſe of Gods fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for that his Saints Continue in their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, is by vertue of his promiſe, and fidelity; wherefore Divines alſo have ſaid, There is ſome kinde of faith that laſts in heaven, which they call <hi>fidem dependentiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre of explication. Now that God is thus true, and faithfull in performing all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what of Spirituall bleſſings, they are ſurely abſolutely promiſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is certainely much miſpriſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods people; Give me leave therefore a little diſtinctly to explicate, how Spirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are convayed in the promiſe: They are of two ſorts; I mean ſo farre as they are in this life vouchſafed. Firſt, Some are as it were the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of our Service. Secondly, Some the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to the Service of God, or the Service it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort we reckon the Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and joy of the holy Ghoſt, whereof ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. Peace and comfort in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Secondly, Theſe are not promiſed Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; But firſt with limitation to expediency; according to the divers tempers of mens inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſome there are whom feeling of theſe favors continually, perhaps would encourage to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſo headſtrong is their naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evill; thoſe God withholds theſe comforts from, and leads them on not without the terrours of a troubled minde to continue in his fear; Some again of a melting, and tender diſpoſition, whom rigour would diſcourage, onely mildneſſe, and comfort incline to obediences; to theſe doth God proportion another kinde of promoting. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Even herein hath God reſerved power to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the ſcandalous ſinnes of his people; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that <hi>David</hi> ſo oft complains of the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 88.15, 16.</note> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours he felt in his ſoul. Thirdly, Withall, his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17340:107"/> Liberty to make good by way of exchange, as thus; Though he grant thee not ſo much peace, and comfort, yet perhaps he gives thee more fear of his Name; more Caſe to depart from evill: and ye may obſerve in many of Gods people, who to this day were never able to apply the promiſes, nor ſcarce ever knew by experience what Peace of Conſcience meant, that yet their lives are moſt holy, they are readieſt in good-works, ſcrupulous of ſinnes that many others ſwallow up. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To put their faith to the Proof; for who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not what he feeles? Fifthly, And where finde we, that the Time, and Seaſon is here limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Peace ſhall be upon them, Gal.</hi> 6.16. and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they feel it not till the houre of their death; many ſuch I have knowne. Sixthly, And univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally thus conceive; No man can ſhew that God hath ſo bound himſelf by promiſe, as to exhibite theſe favours to his children. Firſt, Either in like meaſures. Secondly, Or without interruption: But with theſe limits know it is true; mercy ſhall be upon you, and peace as upon the Iſrael of God.</p>
               <p>There are a ſecond ſort of Spirituall bleſſings which God hath promiſed; which ſerve to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them to the Service of himſelf, and in exerciſe whereof Gods Service ſtands; ſuch are Faith, Hope, Charity, &amp;c. All theſe are promiſed to the Veſſells of mercy; but <hi>de modo quaeritur;</hi> the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of the manner. Firſt, That their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not in this life to be expected; nor their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from mixtute with their imperfections; and conflict with them in their exerciſe, during ſtate of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17340:108"/> this life: Shew me where God hath promiſed, Faith without doubting, Feare without ſecurity, &amp;c. Reaſons of it are; Firſt, To preſerve humility. Secondly, To ſhew that they are not availeable to juſtifie us. Again, in theſe gifts we conſider Two things. Firſt, <hi>Eſsentiam.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Gradum.</hi> A Competency of the gifts God hath promiſed to all his ſervants; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. yet not promiſed to give to all Equality of Degrees and Meaſures; not to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, &amp;c. Reaſons are much what as in the Body. Firſt, Every ones office, and imployment require them not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Secondly, God would by this make us carefull of the means both to beget, and nouriſh Grace within us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, We diſtinguiſh <hi>habitum &amp; exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium;</hi> the habits are permanent, the acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe are oft interrupted. Fourthly, Diverſities there are of eminence in all kinds of ſpirituall gifts; in ſome, more Knowledge, leſſe Affection; in ſome, more Affection then Knowledge; in ſome, more Mercy, in ſome, more Humility, Meekneſſe, Temperance, &amp;c. they are not of them behinde in any gifts, yet many behinde others in meaſures of ſome gifts, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. And thus underſtand, ye ſhall be forced to confeſſe, God is Faithfull and true; unalterably ſuch, and infallibly making good to all his Servants whatſoever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>And this reproves our doubtings ſometimes no leſſe then quarrelſome, and churliſh concerning the Trueth, and faithfulnes of our gracious God; with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17340:108"/> who though he be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. yet is oft charged with breach of promiſe to his children. And ye may obſerve it to iſſue from one of theſe two grounds. Firſt, Miſunderſtanding. Secondly, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of the Promiſes. For the firſt, How many be there who conceive theſe promiſes made abſolutely, when yet, as you have heard, made with limitation? &amp;c. eſpecially when they reflect upon ſpirituall bleſſings; For example, Do theſe things, ye ſhall make your<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> Calling ſure; we have done, yet are not aſſured. Secondly, Peace of Conſcience ſhall follow them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. yet ſcarce ever attain they the benefit in their greateſt ſtudy of New life. Thirdly, Temporalls with the ſtraiteſt hand reached to them: Underſtand ye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt the people; theſe are not ſimply promiſed, but, as ye have heard above explained.</p>
               <p>As for Miſapplication, that ye ſhall obſerve of Two ſorts. Firſt, One reſpects their perſon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The other their ſtate, and behaviour. Firſt, Perſons, they miſtake the qualification of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſuppoſing the outward forme of religion ſufficient to intereſt them in the Promiſes: as they did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. whereas they are not Jews who are ſo outward; nor is the promiſe made to the Ceremony, but to the Subſtance of Piety, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Yea, even among them never ſo exact, yet ſhall ye ſee miſapplication: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there are many think themſelves Gods Children, who are not ſo; ſuch as feel flitting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace, and ſome Knowledge, and Faith, and outward Reformation; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Shall God
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17340:109"/> be thought unfaithfull, becauſe to them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are not performed? It was never intended to any, but to <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> to Iſraelites indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Behaviour; for I would ſuppoſe thee a childe of God; yet as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> in particulars oxorbitant; perhaps thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hadſt comforts of ſpirit, Peace of Conſcience, cheaerfull exerciſe of other gracious gifts, &amp;c. What then? is God therefore unfaithfull? yea, <hi>Let God be</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>true, and every man a lyar;</hi> he never meant thoſe comforts, no, not to his own ſervants, but whil'ſt they demeaned themſelves as ſervants; If therefore thou have failed in thy behaviour; either breaking out to ſcandalous ſin; or ſwelling with Pride, inclined to Preſumption; or neglecting means to cheriſh Grace, &amp;c. ſayeſt thou God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull? rather ſay, That thou thy ſelf haſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the defect of thine own due qualification.</p>
               <p>Build we our ſelves in firme expectation of all good things promiſed, ſo farre as they are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſeem Nature and ordinary Courſe never ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; ſo did<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4.18, 19</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> There are foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of confidence. Firſt, When no means compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, at leaſt apparent, as in the caſe of <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, When means weak, as in Caſe of many. Thirdly, when no means, as in our Saviour. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, When means are oppoſite, as in <hi>Abraham:</hi> Give me that Faith that reſts on naked promiſe of God.</p>
               <p>This is amongſt thoſe vertues, which admit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in the Creature: The faithfull God ownes not perfidious Children. Mans fidelity hath a Twofold relation. Firſt, To God; God
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17340:109"/> not onely bindes himſelf to us by promiſe, but we to God have covenanted our obedience; How ready are we failing of what we deſire, to charge God fooliſhly? when either we miſtake the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or manner of the Promiſe; or elſe, a thouſand to one failed in our Reſtipulation. Secondly, To man; and binds with<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> loſſe to ſupport credit of Fidelity: Oh tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> that our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are as<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 9.4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieremies Iews,</hi> every brother will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and every neighbour deale treacherouſly. When ſhall that golden age returne, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may againe proceed? <hi>Sacerdos eſt, non fallet, Chriſtianus eſt, non mentietur. Da Deus verax, &amp; fidelis in promiſsis. &amp;c.</hi>
